Thesis Structure (updated: 200110)

- Ch1. Introduction
  - Introduction
  - Motivation
  - Research statement
  - Research question
  - Focus on quantitative morphology = urban morphometrics
  - Context. Urban form as something to observe and measure (K Lynch: you cannot know how something should be if you don’t know how it is).
- Ch2. | Background | Existing approaches to classification of urban form
  - UPDATED VERSION IN CH2 DOCUMENT
  - *The first of the three chapters prividing the background for the rest of the thesis, focusing on the existing approaches to the classification of urban form. *
  - The need for the classification
    - *Why is a classification important, what can it bring to the table, why should we bother doing it.*
  - The history of classification attempts
    - *A brief overview if history of classificaiton of urban form focusing on its origins and early attempts.*
  - Existing methods of classification of urban form
    - *Literature review of existing methods of classification and its analysis and description of patterns within the field.*
    - Qualitative
      - Conzen, Duany ...
    - Quantitative
      - Remote sensing
      - Urban Morphology (quantitative)
        - *This is the key focus of the whole chapter and majority of scrutinised works fall into this category. The rest mentioned above and below is to draw a full picture but it does not aim to provide the deep understanding, unlike this part.*
        - units of classification
          - *Assessment based on the unit of classification and its placement on the scale.*
          - gradient of scales
        - number of classes
          - *Assesment absed on the richness of data used for classification as some try to classify based on very few indicators while others aim to use rich set of indicators.*
          - limits
    - Mixed
  - The gap in the systematic classification
    - *The conclusion of the chapter is the understadning the existing approaches and identifying the gap, which is the lack of systematic classfication based on the small-scale units using rich inclusive set of indicators. That should help position my work within field and say what I am bringing new in later stages.*
- Ch3. | Background | Measuring of urban form
  - *Second background chapter focusing on urban morphometrics, its emergence and existing methods and morphometric characters. It is vaguely based on my MSc thesis, but since then it has evolved significantly and the whole analysis is new as well as proposed classification of literature and changes were done in classification system of morphometric characters as well. The previous work will be acknowledged. The content of this chapter mirrors what the revised version of the paper for EPB will be about.*
  - Mapping the scene
    - *Literature review and classification of existing work leading to the understanding of research patterns and the gap of knowledge.*
    - Dual scale classification
      - *Classification based on the extent of research (1) and basic unit (2), enriched by the number of characters used within research, purpose of the research and its synchronicity.*
    - Patterns of research
      - Purpose
      - Scale(s)
    - The gap in the methods
      - *Existing methods do not offer one which has a capability to cover large scale case studies (1) while retaining information on the small scale unit (2), especially considering the number morphometric characters being used (and hence robustness of the method).*[^OR: You should only mention it here, but the gap comes at the end of this chapter. Actually, I would remove it from here.]
  - Classification of characters
    - *Development of classification and nomenclatural framework for systematisation of morphometric characters as it is currently mess both in categorisation and naming. While the section above is newly done, this one shares some principles with my MSc. However, there are significant changes so I feel that it should be included for completenss of the information and properly acknowledged what is original research done within my PhD and what comes from MSc.* [^OR: I don’t think this sits comfortably under the ‘second background chapter’, because it is propositional already; MF: Hmm, let’s put it this way: the aim of the chapter is to understand what can be measured. To do that, we need a way of analyzing it, hence this classification framework? As an analytical tool? Just change the narrative. Because it is in essence the same kind of thing as the matrix used above (which is going to be changed, but that is another story).; OR: IT DOES, BUT YOU DO THIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED A PROBLEM, SO IT HAS A VERY PRECISE ROLE. IT I SMORE THAN JUST AN IMPROVED MATRIX.]
    - The issue of nicknaming
    - Index of Element classification framework
      - Name
      - Category
      - Scale / element
    - Case study on literature
      - Classification of extracted characters
    - The gap in availability of characters\
      - [^OR: THIS IS A ‘SECOND TIER’ GAP]
      - *Classified characters show what have others already worked on and what was ommited. It can help us understanding where the gap is and which characters needs to be developed to provide complex systematic morphometric assesment. Based on this analysis, it is clear that the biggest issue seems to be the lack of methods capturing the diversity of urban form as all other groups provide substantial number of characters to choose from.*
- Ch4. | Background | Numerical taxonomy & ecological perspective
  - *The last of the background chapters should introduce the principle of numerical taxonomy and parallels between natural science and urban morhpology. It gives the understanding of principles used in biology which are being transferred into UM to become the core of the proposed method.*
  - Numerical taxonomy in biology
    - Origins of numerical taxonomy and morphometrics
    - Morphometrics in the age of DNA sequencing
    - Criticism of morphometrics and numerical taxonomy
      - *based on literature, not mine :)*
  - Parallels between biological science and urban morphology (based on EEPUM)
    - *Reiterating the discussion we had during three EEPUM workshops focusing on the question of finding parallel concepts between biology and UM, specifically aimed at the question what is the individual.*
    - The case of individual
  - Transferability of concept of numerical taxonomy into urban morphology
    - Review of principles and their applicability
    - Critical assessment of Jacob Dibble's work
    - City as a community (based on EEPUM)
      - *Discussion on the ecological community-based science applied to urban form as a possible way forward, if we are able to define communities and their composition.*
      - application of ecological perspective on the concept of a city as a complex adaptive system
  - * Comment: The first 2 background chapter conclude with a GAP. Is there one here too? If you don’t want to call it a gap, call it an ‘unexplored/ potential’ but in principle it would be good if all 3 background chapters conclude with something to act upon. The ‘unexplored potential’ could be the definition of city as community and development of all elements and connection that pertain to it
- Ch5. | Propositions
  - hypothesis
  - Difference between UMM and Quantitative methods. Establishing UMM.
  - top-scale methodology
- Ch6. | Core | Morphometric elements of urban form
  - *The first of the core chapters, focusing on the existing morphological elements and their applicability. As there is "an issue of plot" this chapter introduces morphological tessellation and discuss its derivates. Moreover, it argues why urban tissue is the right "individual" unit for this type of analysis and what are the concepts of its definition. The final part proposes Distinct Homogenous Cluster as a morphometric proxy of urban tissue.*
  - Fundamental morphological elements
    - *Overview of know and used elements as building, street, plot, axial line and others.*
  - Data quality, availability and related applicability of methods relying on them
    - *The issue of availability of the data described above, the quality of available data and limitations of methods relying on them.*
  - The issue of plot
  - Morphological tessellation
    - *This section mirrors the content of MT paper for CEUS.*
    - Voronoi tessellation in the research on urban form
    - Morphological tessellation - the method
    - MT and plots - data and comparison method
      - The dataset (Zurich)
      - Definition of MT parameters
      - The informational value of MT vs plots: the 12 morphometric characters 
      - Results
      - Discussion
  - Theory: Relational model of urban form
    - *Introduction of model of urban form used within the rest of morphometric framework based on the identified relation between fundamental elements of form (building-cell-street-node) and definition of vicinity based on the topology (relations) rather than metric definition.*
    - Overlapping relations vs tree-like hierarchy
      - *Building on Alexander's City is not a Tree, this section will explain the issue of hierarchical model of urban form (building -> plot -> street edge -> block -> SA) and provide theoretical background for relational model, which in principle has semi-lattice rahter than tree structure.*
    - Polysemic definition of scale
      - *Scale can be defined in multiple ways (metres, elements, value) and it needs to be clear how do I define it within this work.*
      - Relational definition of scale
        - *Relational definition of scale is based on topological relationship between elements (neighbour < neighbors of neighbour).*
    - Assessing the relational definition of aggregation
      - *Comparision of topological (relational) definition of aggregation and metric, Euclidean and KNN to test whether the hypothesis that relational model is more sensitive to actual patterns within urban form is correct or not. It mirrors paper written for and presented at ISUF Nicosia (which will be also included in the paper I am working on with Will Kerr).*

      - Diversity as a statistical dispersion
      - *To follow the principles of DHC recognition, most of the characters tested above has to be expressed using their 'patterned' versions. That is calculation of interquartile mean and diversity characters for each one of them within 3 topological steps on MT. These characters will then be used within clustering algorithm itself.*
      - Collinearity
    - Gaussian clustering
      - *Introduction of selected clustering method and reasoning for its selection.*
      - Dimensionality issue
        - *As resulting morphometric description of each building/cell has ~300 values, with 140 000 buildings, we are facing 'dimensionality curse'.  This issue is discussed in relation to clustering and possible reducing of dimensionality (PCA, Factor analysis).*
      - Clustering method

    - DHC-based characters
      - *Measuring characters based on the actual identified DHCs to obtain 'morphometric profile' of each one of them. These profiles will be then used as an input value for hierarchical clustering.*
    - Methods of hierarchical clustering
      - *Overview of possible methods of hierarchical clustering and selection of the most suitable ones.*
    - Comparison of possible methods
      - *Both DHC-based characters and hierarchical clustering offer more possible pathways, so these are tested and compared against each other and validated (see next section).*
    - Validation of DHC through resulting taxonomy
      - *As the meaning of DHC hardly has any counterpart in existing data, it is rather complicated to validate DHC as such. However, it it possible to validate taxonomy, using some of its levels and comparing them to available data on development period, land use or other.*
  - Case study Prague
    - *Application of taxonomy methodology on the case of Prague and validation of results.*
    - comparison
    - validation

  - Extended case study
    - *Morphometric analysis of one or more other cities to test the ability to compare geographically distinct urban forms and generate combined taxonomic tree as a way towards the Urban Atlas.*
    - Combined taxonomic tree
  - Intepretation of the tree
    - *Taxonomic tree needs specific attention regarding its interpretation as the detail we can read can vary based on the stability of urban form under scrutiny.*
    - Different branches allow different distiction
  - Profiling of taxa
    - *The final part of the core of the research is profiling of selected taxa using their morhphometric values. We can either provide full profile of ~300 values or identify those which are the most significant for each of the taxa.*
- Ch9. Synthesis
  - "The last chapter which is currently only crudely outlined as the major part of the discussion will be based on the data I do not have at this moment (final clustering, taxonomy, extetended case study)."
