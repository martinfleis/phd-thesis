* What is urban tissue
* Why is it worth studying
* How others approached it
* City as an ecosystem
* What is an individual within this ecosystem
* Principles of identification of individuals
* Introduction of DHC (as a theoretical concept)

## What is the *individual* in the urban form?

* We are trying to identify and describe distinct kinds of urban form. *Individuals* forming the population - the city.
* Dibble et al. used Sanctuary Areas (SA), I argue that the concept of SA is limited. By qualitative definition of SA, and by possible heterogeneity of it. 
	* The problem with SAs is that their definition and identification is *phylogenic* process, it is based on the process of development of the settlement. The rest of the taxonomic systematisation is, however, based on purely *phenetic* attributes.
	* Use of SA as OTU assumes that whole cities are in fact ideal according to ‘Emergent Neighbourhood Model’ (Mehaffy et al). Even the authors states that they are not (e.g. the three pathologies). While the concept of SA in this model perfectly works, in case of unrestricted taxonomy it doesn’t.
* We are looking for the structure indicating the smallest distinct kind (Sneath and Sokal) of urban form, which urban morphologists define as urban tissue (Kropf)

## Urban Tissue and similar concepts

* Urban tissue has several definitions
	* principal unit of growth
	* the ensemble of aggregated buildings, spaces and access routes (Cannigian analysis)(Samuels, 1982, p.3)
	* a distinct area of a settlement in all three dimensions, characterised by a unique combination of streets, blocks/plot series, plots, buildings, structures and materials and usually the result of a distinct process of formation at a particular time or period (Kropf, 2017)
* Urban morphologists are using a few concepts which are very similar. Those are **urban tissue**, conzenian **plan unit**, cannigian **tessuto urbano**, and **urban structural unit**. However, there are minor differences. 
	* We can say, that **urban tissue** is a broad theoretical concept, which is defined above. 
	* All the other, are methodological terms capturing urban tissue in different ways. Conzenian plan unit is based on qualitative analysis of two-dimensional town plans, 'tessuto urbano' by Muratori, Cannigia and Maffei uses the principle of aggregation of smaller hierarchical elements (also qualitative approach),  urban structural unit, originating in studies of metabolism of urban systems (Pauliet and Duhme, 1998 + some others) is mixed-use method incorporating, beside the built form, also structure of open spaces (Osmond).
	* I am proposing another concept of capturing the urban tissue.
		* **the smallest distinct physiognomically homogenous cluster** (DHC)
			* In short, DHC is formed by clustering method based on measurable characters.
		* Unlike methods described above, DHC is purely quantitative one

One of the result of the research should therefore be the taxonomy of urban tissues (defined as DHC).
