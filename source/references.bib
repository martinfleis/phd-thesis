For this purpose, numerous shape analysis and recognition methods with different degrees of complexity have so far been developed. Among them, relatively simple indices are widely used in spatial applications, but their performance has not been investigated sufficiently, particularly for building footprints (BFs). Therefore, this article focuses on BF shape characterisation with shape indices and classification schemes in a GIS environment. This study consists of four phases. In the first phase, the criteria for BF shape complexity were identified, and accordingly, benchmark data was constructed by human experts in three shape complexity categories. In the second phase, 18 shape indices were selected from the literature and automatically computed in GIS. The performance of these indices was then statistically assessed with histograms, correlation matrix and boxplots, and consequently four indices were found to be appropr...},

Of particular importance to this endeavour is the idea of urban types. However, on closer scrutiny, while such types may capture the symbolic dimension of urban form, they frequently do not capture its performance or functional dimension. This prohibits precise policy formulation on the topic. This paper first presents a methodology for generating urban types relevant to urban practice (using analytical and statistical methods) and, second, an empirical test of the differences in performance concerning their influence on the presence of people in public space (an essential driver of many other urban processes). For this reason, a large (and to our knowledge unique) pedestrian survey of three European metropolitan areas was conducted and used to test the performance of the urban types developed. The results prove that the methodology for developing the types is robust, as it picks up generally recognised spatial patterns in all three cities. Further, the types were able to explain the intensity of pedestrian flow, its spatial distribution and fluctuations of intensity in space and time. These are vital steps forward and provide more useable typologies in urban planning and design practice.},

Despite the fact that it is often described as the basic element in the pattern of land divisions, which are essential as organizational frameworks for urban form, studies offering comprehensive descriptions and classifications of plot systems are quite scant. The aim of the paper is to introduce a classification of plot systems into typologies based on five European cities, in order to distinguish particular spatial differences and similarities in terms of their plot structure. The proposed typologies are developed using unsupervised k-means cluster analysis based on numeric attributes derived from central theories in urban morphology. The introduced typologies are essentially configurational, allowing collective systematic properties of plot systems to be captured. Numeric attributes include plot differentiation (or plot size), plot frontage and compactness ratio, corresponding to essential qualities of plot systems such as the capacity to carry differences in space, the ability to operate as interface between street and building and providing a framework for evolution of built form over time. All three attributes are translated into configurational measures in order to capture the context of the plot system, rather than the parameters of individual plots. The combination of these deductively defined variables with algorithmically defined classification methods results in seven plot types that can be used to scale up traditional urban morphological analysis to whole city regions and conduct substantial comparison of patterns within, but also between these regions. Further, it also makes it possible to describe commonly recognized plot patterns and discover new ones.},

These measures include those common in urban design and transportation studies, as well as advanced measures of the structure and topology of the network.

Drawing from the features of existing street network models that offer disaggregate, scalable and relational analysis of the spatial configuration of urban areas, it presents a multi-modal urban network (MMUN) model that describes an urban environment using three systems \textemdash{} private transport (i.e. car, bicycle and pedestrian), public transport (i.e. rail, tram, metro and bus), and land use. This model offers a unifying framework that allows the use of a range of analysis metrics and conceptions of distance (i.e. physical, topological and cognitive), and aims to be simple and applicable in practice. An implementation of the MMUN is created for the Randstad city- region in the Netherlands. This is analyzed with network centrality measures in a series of experiments, testing its performance against empirical data. The experiments yield conclusions regarding the use of different distance parameters, the choice of network centrality metrics, and the relevant combinations of multi-modal layers to describe the structure and configuration of a city-region},

Most street network models have artificial boundaries, and there are principles that can be applied to minimise or eliminate the effect of the boundary condition. However, the extent of this impact has not been systematically studied and remains little understood. In this article we present an empirical study on the impact of different network model boundaries on the results of closeness and betweenness centrality analysis of street networks. The results demonstrate that the centrality measures are affected differently by the edge effect, and that the same centrality measure is affected differently depending on the type of network distance used. These results highlight the importance, in any study of street networks, of defining the network's boundary in a way that is relevant to the research question, and of selecting appropriate analysis parameters and statistics.},

Evaluating the form of urban fabric is fundamentally important for urban design practice and relevant policy making. However, the quantitative methods and attempts are rare due to the lack of available methods. To address this deficiency, this article presents a GIS-based method to measure the homogeneity of urban fabric by extracting attributes directly from the geometry of 2D building footprints, including the angles between buildings, areas of building footprints, and distances between buildings. These attributes are calculated for separate overlaid grids in the open space between buildings, where each grid holds the measured values for one attribute. We test the method on a prototype, which we applied on four real sites using OpenStreetMap data. The results show how to categorize different kinds of urban fabric based on the new measure},

Remote sensing techniques are now often applied to monitor urbanisation and changes in settlement patterns. In particular, increasing availability of very high resolution imagery ({$<$}1 m spatial resolution) and computing power is enabling complete sets of settlement data in the form of building footprints to be extracted from imagery. These settlement data provide information on the changes occurring in cities, particularly in countries which may lack other data on urbanisation. While spatially detailed, extracted building footprints typically lack other information that identify building types or can be used to differentiate intraurban land uses or neighbourhood types. This work demonstrates an approach to classifying settlement types through multi-scale spatial patterns of urban morphology visible in building footprint data extracted from very high resolution imagery. The work uses a Gaussian mixture modelling approach to select and hierarchically merge components into clusters. The results are maps classifying settlement types on a high spatial resolution (100 m) grid. The approach is applied in Kaduna, Nigeria; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo; and Maputo, Mozambique and demonstrates the potential of computational methods to take advantage of large spatial datasets and extract meaningful information to support monitoring of urban areas. The model-based approach produces a hierarchy of potential clustering solutions, and we suggest that this can be used in partnership with local knowledge of the context when creating settlement typologies.},

  abstract = {There is a lack of clarity in urban morphology in the use of the terms `plot' and `lot'. The complications arise in large part because these terms are used to refer to several things. Further ambiguities arise because the concept of property is not univocal, and the boundaries corresponding to the different meanings of plot do not necessarily coincide. An attendant problem is that distinct aspects of urban form are conflated into a single, ill-d\- efined entity. Given the significance of the plot in building typology and urban morphology, the ambiguities in its definition raise questions about the role of the plot in the generation and transformation of urban form and in particular in the central phenomenon of persistence and the differential rates of change between street pattern, plot pattern and building pattern. The aim of this paper is therefore to clarify the terms plot and lot by examining the pertinent characteristics that are used to define them and the underlying relationships and logic they entail. The resolution offered in conclusion is that the fundamental basis for defining a plot is rooted in human behaviour and our interactions with both our environment and each other. This may then provide a fruitful basis for investigating the phenomenon of persistence in more detail.},

  abstract = {Measuring and characterizing urban form is an important task for planners and policy analysts. This paper compares eighteen metrics of urban form for 542 neighborhoods in Salt Lake County, Utah. The comparison was made in the context of characterizing three neighborhood types from different time periods: pre-suburban (1891\textendash{}1944), suburban (1945\textendash{}1990), and late-suburban (1990\textendash{}2007). We used correlation analysis, within and across time periods, to assess each metric's ability to uniquely character-ize urban form; and we used linear regression to assess the ability to distinguish neighborhood type. Three of the metrics show redundancy and two did not capture differences in urban form for the case study. Based on our findings, we recommend thirteen of the eighteen metrics for planners and policy ana-lysts who want to quantify urban form using spatial data that are commonly available. Furthermore, our case study shows that despite policy efforts to encourage ''smart growth,'' urban neighborhoods in Salt Lake County continue to exhibit characteristics of ''sprawl.'' These findings suggest the effectiveness of smart growth policies in Salt Lake County have had limited effect.},

  abstract = {The network metaphor in the analysis of urban and territorial cases has a long tradition especially in transportation/land-use planning and economic geography. More recently, urban design has brought its contribution by means of the "space syntax" methodology. All these approaches, though under different terms like accessibility, proximity, integration,connectivity, cost or effort, focus on the idea that some places (or streets) are more important than others because they are more central. The study of centrality in complex systems,however, originated in other scientific areas, namely in structural sociology, well before its use in urban studies; moreover, as a structural property of the system, centrality has never been extensively investigated metrically in geographic networks as it has been topologically in a wide range of other relational networks like social, biological or technological. After two previous works on some structural properties of the dual and primal graph representations of urban street networks (Porta et al. cond-mat/0411241; Crucitti et al. physics/0504163), in this paper we provide an in-depth investigation of centrality in the primal approach as compared to the dual one, with a special focus on potentials for urban design.},

  abstract = {Various studies in the field of urban planning and design have given recommendations for "good urban forms," suggesting that specific spatial characteristics inform the quality of an urban landscape and the way people perceive and behave in them. When modeling spatial behavior in the form of location choice models or hedonic prices, we should reflect these spatial characteristics through the integration of quantitative attributes such as model variables, which is currently only done in a very limited way. The increasing availability of disaggregated geodata enlarges the options to characterize urban morphology in the form of such attributes. The question for the researcher is which attributes are most useful to reflect characteristics of urban morphology and how can they be processed from the given data. In this paper, we want to address this issue and give an overview of quantitative descriptions of urban morphology. We base our work on a data model that is simple enough to allow for reproducibility in any study area. These attributes are classified in multiple scales to reflect different perceptions of urban morphology. In a case study on the canton of Zurich, we furthermore prove how these characteristics allow for the definition of urban typologies at different scales.},
