This paper clarifies some apparent confusion over the use of the coefficient of determination, R(2), as a measure of model fit and predictive power in QSAR and QSPR modeling. R(2) (or r(2)) has been used in various contexts in the literature in conjunction with training and test data for both ordinary linear regression and regression through the origin as well as with linear and nonlinear regression models. We analyze the widely adopted model fit criteria suggested by Golbraikh and Tropsha ( J. Mol. Graphics Modell. 2002 , 20 , 269 - 276 ) in a strict statistical manner. Shortcomings in these criteria are identified, and a clearer and simpler alternative method to characterize model predictivity is provided. The intent is not to repeat the well-documented arguments for model validation using test data but rather to guide the application of R(2) as a model fit statistic. Examples are used to illustrate both correct and incorrect uses of R(2). Reporting the root-mean-square error or equivalent measures of dispersion, which are typically of more practical importance than R(2), is also encouraged, and important challenges in addressing the needs of different categories of users such as computational chemists, experimental scientists, and regulatory decision support specialists are outlined.},

The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify ?outliers,? as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

However, researchers, policy makers or citizens who want to make use of OpenStreetMap (OSM) have little information about whether it can be relied upon in a particular geographic setting. In this paper, we use two complementary, independent methods to assess the completeness of OSM in each country in the world. First, we undertake a visual assessment of OSM data against satellite imagery, which provides the input for estimates based on a multilevel regression and poststratification model. Second, we fit sigmoid curves to the cumulative length of contributions, and use them to estimate the saturation level for each country. We find that globally, OSM is {$\sim$}83\% complete, and more than 40\% of countries \textendash{} including several in the developing world \textendash{} have a fully mapped street network. We find that well-governed countries with good internet access tend to be more complete, and that completeness has a U-shaped relationship with population density \textendash{} both sparsely populated areas and dense cities are the best mapped. We then apply our method to estimate the total length of road in each country, and find that existing global datasets used by the World Bank undercount roads by more than 30\%.},

Therefore, this article focuses on BF shape characterisation with shape indices and classification schemes in a GIS environment. This study consists of four phases. In the first phase, the criteria for BF shape complexity were identified, and accordingly, benchmark data was constructed by human experts in three shape complexity categories. In the second phase, 18 shape indices were selected from the literature and automatically computed in GIS. The performance of these indices was then statistically assessed with histograms, correlation matrix and boxplots, and consequently four indices were found to be appropr...},

Of particular importance to this endeavour is the idea of urban types. However, on closer scrutiny, while such types may capture the symbolic dimension of urban form, they frequently do not capture its performance or functional dimension. This prohibits precise policy formulation on the topic. This paper first presents a methodology for generating urban types relevant to urban practice (using analytical and statistical methods) and, second, an empirical test of the differences in performance concerning their influence on the presence of people in public space (an essential driver of many other urban processes). For this reason, a large (and to our knowledge unique) pedestrian survey of three European metropolitan areas was conducted and used to test the performance of the urban types developed. The results prove that the methodology for developing the types is robust, as it picks up generally recognised spatial patterns in all three cities. Further, the types were able to explain the intensity of pedestrian flow, its spatial distribution and fluctuations of intensity in space and time. These are vital steps forward and provide more useable typologies in urban planning and design practice.},

Despite the fact that it is often described as the basic element in the pattern of land divisions, which are essential as organizational frameworks for urban form, studies offering comprehensive descriptions and classifications of plot systems are quite scant. The aim of the paper is to introduce a classification of plot systems into typologies based on five European cities, in order to distinguish particular spatial differences and similarities in terms of their plot structure. The proposed typologies are developed using unsupervised k-means cluster analysis based on numeric attributes derived from central theories in urban morphology. The introduced typologies are essentially configurational, allowing collective systematic properties of plot systems to be captured. Numeric attributes include plot differentiation (or plot size), plot frontage and compactness ratio, corresponding to essential qualities of plot systems such as the capacity to carry differences in space, the ability to operate as interface between street and building and providing a framework for evolution of built form over time. All three attributes are translated into configurational measures in order to capture the context of the plot system, rather than the parameters of individual plots. The combination of these deductively defined variables with algorithmically defined classification methods results in seven plot types that can be used to scale up traditional urban morphological analysis to whole city regions and conduct substantial comparison of patterns within, but also between these regions. Further, it also makes it possible to describe commonly recognized plot patterns and discover new ones.},

  abstract = {The eld of Urban Morphology is a branch of academic research focussing on the study of urban form. Although prior works in this eld had been undertaken earlier, the formal establishment of the discipline of Urban Morphology can be traced back to the establishment of the International Seminar on Urban Form in 1994, and the subsequent Journal of Urban Morphology. The e orts in this eld are found to be largely reliant, from the point of view of methods and de nitions, on two foundational research roots, the Conzenian and the Muratorian processes. Both of these dominant traditions emerged independently in the 1960's. Contemporary works in the eld are found to consistently uphold the status quo within the discipline and fail to challenge or validate the very de nitions of form used so frequently and implicitly in all assessments. This thesis recognises that the eld of Urban Morphology lacks a rigorous lexicon of the urban form, as well as a quantitatively-driven, systematic and comprehensive means of analysing and comparing urban form. A methodology is developed as a systematic, quantitative and comprehensive process of measuring, de ning and classifying urban form. This process entails the study of the measurements of urban form and is termed Urban Morphometrics. Central to Urban Morphometrics is the assignment of rigorous de nitions to the urban elements, called Constituent Urban Elements. A Methodology of measuring these elements and their inter-relationships at the scale of the Sanctuary Area is tested rigorously against Validation, Robustness and Universality criteria, and culminates in the rst taxonomy of urban form. Largely following statistical processes of biological morphometrics, this analysis reveals the relative importance of the various measurements of urban form and derives a minimal set of criteria for measuring urban form. Urban Morphometrics is then integrated into a more typical study of Urban Morphology and later tested to reveal its relevance in professional planning practice. Finally, the classi cation of urban form is used as a platform for discussing the theory of Urban Evolution and the rst bifurcation in the evolutionary pathways of cities, evidenced through the resulting classi cation of urban form.},

As opposed to the existing approaches that are based on classifying images using pixel level methods, we propose to use objects as textural primitives and exploit their spatial patterns. First, the primitives are detected using spectral and morphological processing. Then, these primitives form the nodes of a graph where the neighborhood information is obtained through Voronoi tessellation of the image scene. Next, this graph is clustered by thresholding its minimum spanning tree. Finally, the resulting clusters are classified as regular or irregular by examining the distributions of the angles between neighboring nodes. Experiments using Ikonos images show that the application of the proposed model where buildings are used as the primitives and building groups are automatically classified as organized or unorganized can extract valuable information about urban development.},

  abstract = {This article proposes urban network models as instruments to measure urban form, structure and function indicators for the assessment of the sustainable mobility of urban areas, thanks to their capacity to describe the detail of a local environment in the context of a wider city-region. Drawing from the features of existing street network models that offer disaggregate, scalable and relational analysis of the spatial configuration of urban areas, it presents a multi-modal urban network (MMUN) model that describes an urban environment using three systems \textemdash{} private transport (i.e. car, bicycle and pedestrian), public transport (i.e. rail, tram, metro and bus), and land use. This model offers a unifying framework that allows the use of a range of analysis metrics and conceptions of distance (i.e. physical, topological and cognitive), and aims to be simple and applicable in practice. An implementation of the MMUN is created for the Randstad city- region in the Netherlands. This is analyzed with network centrality measures in a series of experiments, testing its performance against empirical data. The experiments yield conclusions regarding the use of different distance parameters, the choice of network centrality metrics, and the relevant combinations of multi-modal layers to describe the structure and configuration of a city-region},

  abstract = {With increased interest in the use of network analysis to study the urban and regional environment, it is important to understand the sensitivity of centrality analysis results to the so-called ''edge effect''. Most street network models have artificial boundaries, and there are principles that can be applied to minimise or eliminate the effect of the boundary condition. However, the extent of this impact has not been systematically studied and remains little understood. In this article we present an empirical study on the impact of different network model boundaries on the results of closeness and betweenness centrality analysis of street networks. The results demonstrate that the centrality measures are affected differently by the edge effect, and that the same centrality measure is affected differently depending on the type of network distance used. These results highlight the importance, in any study of street networks, of defining the network's boundary in a way that is relevant to the research question, and of selecting appropriate analysis parameters and statistics.},

Evaluating the form of urban fabric is fundamentally important for urban design practice and relevant policy making. However, the quantitative methods and attempts are rare due to the lack of available methods. To address this deficiency, this article presents a GIS-based method to measure the homogeneity of urban fabric by extracting attributes directly from the geometry of 2D building footprints, including the angles between buildings, areas of building footprints, and distances between buildings. These attributes are calculated for separate overlaid grids in the open space between buildings, where each grid holds the measured values for one attribute. We test the method on a prototype, which we applied on four real sites using OpenStreetMap data. The results show how to categorize different kinds of urban fabric based on the new measure},

  abstract = {Urban settlements and urbanised populations continue to grow rapidly and much of this transition is occurring in less developed countries. Remote sensing techniques are now often applied to monitor urbanisation and changes in settlement patterns. In particular, increasing availability of very high resolution imagery ({$<$}1 m spatial resolution) and computing power is enabling complete sets of settlement data in the form of building footprints to be extracted from imagery. These settlement data provide information on the changes occurring in cities, particularly in countries which may lack other data on urbanisation. While spatially detailed, extracted building footprints typically lack other information that identify building types or can be used to differentiate intraurban land uses or neighbourhood types. This work demonstrates an approach to classifying settlement types through multi-scale spatial patterns of urban morphology visible in building footprint data extracted from very high resolution imagery. The work uses a Gaussian mixture modelling approach to select and hierarchically merge components into clusters. The results are maps classifying settlement types on a high spatial resolution (100 m) grid. The approach is applied in Kaduna, Nigeria; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo; and Maputo, Mozambique and demonstrates the potential of computational methods to take advantage of large spatial datasets and extract meaningful information to support monitoring of urban areas. The model-based approach produces a hierarchy of potential clustering solutions, and we suggest that this can be used in partnership with local knowledge of the context when creating settlement typologies.},

  abstract = {There is a lack of clarity in urban morphology in the use of the terms `plot' and `lot'. The complications arise in large part because these terms are used to refer to several things. Further ambiguities arise because the concept of property is not univocal, and the boundaries corresponding to the different meanings of plot do not necessarily coincide. An attendant problem is that distinct aspects of urban form are conflated into a single, ill-d\- efined entity. Given the significance of the plot in building typology and urban morphology, the ambiguities in its definition raise questions about the role of the plot in the generation and transformation of urban form and in particular in the central phenomenon of persistence and the differential rates of change between street pattern, plot pattern and building pattern. The aim of this paper is therefore to clarify the terms plot and lot by examining the pertinent characteristics that are used to define them and the underlying relationships and logic they entail. The resolution offered in conclusion is that the fundamental basis for defining a plot is rooted in human behaviour and our interactions with both our environment and each other. This may then provide a fruitful basis for investigating the phenomenon of persistence in more detail.},

In this study, building generalization is decomposed into two steps, i.e. building grouping and generalization execution. The neighbourhood model in urban morphology provides global constraints for guiding the global partitioning of building sets on the whole map by means of roads and rivers, by which enclaves, blocks, superblocks or neighbourhoods are formed; whereas the local constraints from Gestalt principles provide criteria for the further grouping of enclaves, blocks, superblocks and/or neighbourhoods. In the grouping process, graph theory, Delaunay triangulation and the Voronoi diagram are employed as supporting techniques. After grouping, some useful information, such as the sum of the building's area, the mean separation and the standard deviation of the separation of buildings, is attached to each group. By means of the attached information, an appropriate operation is selected to generalize the corresponding groups. Indeed, the methodology described brings together a number of welldeveloped theories/techniques, including graph theory, Delaunay triangulation, the Voronoi diagram, urban morphology and Gestalt theory, in such a way that multiscale products can be derived.},

This paper compares eighteen metrics of urban form for 542 neighborhoods in Salt Lake County, Utah. The comparison was made in the context of characterizing three neighborhood types from different time periods: pre-suburban (1891\textendash{}1944), suburban (1945\textendash{}1990), and late-suburban (1990\textendash{}2007). We used correlation analysis, within and across time periods, to assess each metric's ability to uniquely character-ize urban form; and we used linear regression to assess the ability to distinguish neighborhood type. Three of the metrics show redundancy and two did not capture differences in urban form for the case study. Based on our findings, we recommend thirteen of the eighteen metrics for planners and policy ana-lysts who want to quantify urban form using spatial data that are commonly available. Furthermore, our case study shows that despite policy efforts to encourage ''smart growth,'' urban neighborhoods in Salt Lake County continue to exhibit characteristics of ''sprawl.'' These findings suggest the effectiveness of smart growth policies in Salt Lake County have had limited effect.},

More recently, urban design has brought its contribution by means of the "space syntax" methodology. All these approaches, though under different terms like accessibility, proximity, integration,connectivity, cost or effort, focus on the idea that some places (or streets) are more important than others because they are more central. The study of centrality in complex systems,however, originated in other scientific areas, namely in structural sociology, well before its use in urban studies; moreover, as a structural property of the system, centrality has never been extensively investigated metrically in geographic networks as it has been topologically in a wide range of other relational networks like social, biological or technological. After two previous works on some structural properties of the dual and primal graph representations of urban street networks (Porta et al. cond-mat/0411241; Crucitti et al. physics/0504163), in this paper we provide an in-depth investigation of centrality in the primal approach as compared to the dual one, with a special focus on potentials for urban design.},

Some of us have recently argued that what we still miss is the serious consideration of the factor of time in urbanism, or, in other words, a deeper ?time-conscious? approach (Thwaites, Porta, Romice, \textbackslash\& Greaves, 2008). Inevitably, that means focusing on change as the essential dynamic of evolution in the built environment, which in turn leads to re-addressing concepts like control, self-organization and community participation. After time and change have been finally firmly placed at the centre stage, the whole discipline of urban planning and design, its conceptual equipment as well as its operational toolbox, reveals its weaknesses under a new light and calls for the construction of a different scenario. This paper poses the problem of this scenario in disciplinary terms, it argues about its premises and outlines its essential features. The scope of this paper is not to deliver a comprehensive model for a new approach to urban planning and design, but to set the right framework and rise the right questions so that we can start thinking of issues such as urban regeneration, informal settlements and massive urbanization, community participation and representation, beauty and humanity in space, in a different way.},

The increasing availability of disaggregated geodata enlarges the options to characterize urban morphology in the form of such attributes. The question for the researcher is which attributes are most useful to reflect characteristics of urban morphology and how can they be processed from the given data. In this paper, we want to address this issue and give an overview of quantitative descriptions of urban morphology. We base our work on a data model that is simple enough to allow for reproducibility in any study area. These attributes are classified in multiple scales to reflect different perceptions of urban morphology. In a case study on the canton of Zurich, we furthermore prove how these characteristics allow for the definition of urban typologies at different scales.},

  abstract = {Geo-spatial data available to researchers and practitioners has increased substantially over the last decades, offering new opportunities for analyzing and characterizing locations and their spatial environment in an objective way. Various studies in the field of urban planning and design have given recommendations on ``good urban form'', suggesting that especially characteristics of the urban morphology inform the quality of locations and additionally influence spatial behavior. While we find a growing number of quantitative spatial models such as hedonic price models, location choice models, or applied machine learning algorithms, characteristics describing the urban morphology are still rarely reported in these. One reason can be found in the limited knowledge on how to characterize the urban morphology best. In this chapter, we address this deficit and define attributes that are suitable to characterize the urban morphology in quantitative means at different scales. We show how these can be processed from a data model that is simple enough to allow for reproducibility in most study areas and process them for the case study of Switzerland. Finally, we use the attributes to define urban typologies through clustering methods. These are compared on their outcome, their consistency, and interpretation.},

Though primarily developed for the analysis of urban street-and building-networks, the tools are equally suited for other spatial networks, such as railway networks, highway networks, or utility networks. Unlike previous network centrality tools that operate with two network},
