  abstract = {The importance of the plot (also referred to as 'parcel','lot'or 'property') as one of the fundamental elements of urban form is well recognized within the field of urban morphology. It has been described as a basic element in the pattern of land divisions that works as an organizational grid for urban form. A distinctive feature of the plot is its ambiguous character: it is at the same time a legal unit defining property rights, a spatially defined physical entity and an institutional tool designating land use in urban planning. In urban space, these~\ldots{}},
