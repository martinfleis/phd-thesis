This paper clarifies some apparent confusion over the use of the coefficient of determination, R(2), as a measure of model fit and predictive power in QSAR and QSPR modeling. R(2) (or r(2)) has been used in various contexts in the literature in conjunction with training and test data for both ordinary linear regression and regression through the origin as well as with linear and nonlinear regression models. We analyze the widely adopted model fit criteria suggested by Golbraikh and Tropsha ( J. Mol. Graphics Modell. 2002 , 20 , 269 - 276 ) in a strict statistical manner. Shortcomings in these criteria are identified, and a clearer and simpler alternative method to characterize model predictivity is provided. The intent is not to repeat the well-documented arguments for model validation using test data but rather to guide the application of R(2) as a model fit statistic. Examples are used to illustrate both correct and incorrect uses of R(2). Reporting the root-mean-square error or equivalent measures of dispersion, which are typically of more practical importance than R(2), is also encouraged, and important challenges in addressing the needs of different categories of users such as computational chemists, experimental scientists, and regulatory decision support specialists are outlined.},

In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify ?outliers,? as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

It is assumed by several authors that urban morphology has a fractal or monofractal nature. However, not all the urban patterns can be considered as monofractal because of the presence of different morphologies. Therefore, a single fractal dimension may not always be enough to describe urban morphology. In this sense, a multifractal approach serves to tackle this problem by describing urban areas in terms of a set of fractal dimensions. With this aim in mind, two different neighbourhoods of the city of Cordoba, in Andalusia (Spain), are analysed by using the Sandbox multifractal method and lacunarity. We analyse the street patterns represented by axial maps and obtained from the Space Syntax algorithm. The results suggest that the R\'enyi dimension spectrum is superior to a single fractal dimension to describe the urban morphology of Cordoba, given the presence of regular and irregular street layouts established under different planning and socio-economic regimes. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, researchers, policy makers or citizens who want to make use of OpenStreetMap (OSM) have little information about whether it can be relied upon in a particular geographic setting. In this paper, we use two complementary, independent methods to assess the completeness of OSM in each country in the world. First, we undertake a visual assessment of OSM data against satellite imagery, which provides the input for estimates based on a multilevel regression and poststratification model. Second, we fit sigmoid curves to the cumulative length of contributions, and use them to estimate the saturation level for each country. We find that globally, OSM is {$\sim$}83\% complete, and more than 40\% of countries \textendash{} including several in the developing world \textendash{} have a fully mapped street network. We find that well-governed countries with good internet access tend to be more complete, and that completeness has a U-shaped relationship with population density \textendash{} both sparsely populated areas and dense cities are the best mapped. We then apply our method to estimate the total length of road in each country, and find that existing global datasets used by the World Bank undercount roads by more than 30\%.},

Therefore, this article focuses on BF shape characterisation with shape indices and classification schemes in a GIS environment. This study consists of four phases.

The fractal dimension of such curves is formally introduced, and two computer methods for approximating curve length at different scales -- the structured walk and equipaced polygon methods -- are outlined. Fractal dimensions can then be calculated by performing log-log regressions of curve length on various scales. These ideas are tested on the urban boundary of Cardiff, and this reveals that the fractal dimension lies between 1.23 and 1.29. The appropriateness of fractal geometry in describing man-made phenomena such as urban form is discussed in the light of these tests, but further research is obviously required into the robustness of the methods used, the relevance of self-similarity to urban development, and the variation in fractal dimension over time and space.},

Of particular importance to this endeavour is the idea of urban types. However, on closer scrutiny, while such types may capture the symbolic dimension of urban form, they frequently do not capture its performance or functional dimension. This prohibits precise policy formulation on the topic. This paper first presents a methodology for generating urban types relevant to urban practice (using analytical and statistical methods) and, second, an empirical test of the differences in performance concerning their influence on the presence of people in public space (an essential driver of many other urban processes). For this reason, a large (and to our knowledge unique) pedestrian survey of three European metropolitan areas was conducted and used to test the performance of the urban types developed. The results prove that the methodology for developing the types is robust, as it picks up generally recognised spatial patterns in all three cities. Further, the types were able to explain the intensity of pedestrian flow, its spatial distribution and fluctuations of intensity in space and time. These are vital steps forward and provide more useable typologies in urban planning and design practice.},

Despite the fact that it is often described as the basic element in the pattern of land divisions, which are essential as organizational frameworks for urban form, studies offering comprehensive descriptions and classifications of plot systems are quite scant. The aim of the paper is to introduce a classification of plot systems into typologies based on five European cities, in order to distinguish particular spatial differences and similarities in terms of their plot structure. The proposed typologies are developed using unsupervised k-means cluster analysis based on numeric attributes derived from central theories in urban morphology. The introduced typologies are essentially configurational, allowing collective systematic properties of plot systems to be captured. Numeric attributes include plot differentiation (or plot size), plot frontage and compactness ratio, corresponding to essential qualities of plot systems such as the capacity to carry differences in space, the ability to operate as interface between street and building and providing a framework for evolution of built form over time. All three attributes are translated into configurational measures in order to capture the context of the plot system, rather than the parameters of individual plots. The combination of these deductively defined variables with algorithmically defined classification methods results in seven plot types that can be used to scale up traditional urban morphological analysis to whole city regions and conduct substantial comparison of patterns within, but also between these regions. Further, it also makes it possible to describe commonly recognized plot patterns and discover new ones.},

These measures include those common in urban design and transportation studies, as well as advanced measures of the structure and topology of the network. Finally, this article presents a simple case study using OSMnx to construct and analyze street networks in Portland, Oregon.},

The latter is implemented in order to study the spatial interactions between network phenomena and spaces and to provide further elements for the analysis of urban shape. The study is focused in particular on understanding spatial patterns drawn by networks and in helping with the delimitation of city centres. Different approaches are used to obtain the two indices: a grid-based analysis and a spatial density estimator based on Kernel Density Estimation. The two methodologies are analysed and compared using point data for the urban road network junctions and street numbers as house location identifiers in the Trieste (Italy) Municipality area. The density analysis is also used on road network junctions' data for the city of Swindon (UK) in order to test the methodology on a different urban area.},

In seeking to provide empirical data to advance the debate, one of the key problems researchers face is the task of measuring urban compactness. Research on the compact city is hampered both by a lack of consensus on its meaning and by the absence of recognised indicators for measuring it. This paper describes the development of a large set of urban compactness indicators used in an investigation of social sustainability outcomes in twenty-five English towns and cities. The paper begins by identifying and defining the different aspects of urban compactness, then outlines the indicators (including sources and methods) used for measuring each of these aspects. Finally, the values of these indicators for a range of English towns and cities are presented and reviewed. The aim of the paper is to contribute methodological tools to the compact city debate and provide a model for further research, essential in this field.},

  abstract = {Understanding temporal urban growth process is crucial to the interpretation of urban morphology and a key challenge for the study of rapid urbanization in contemporary China. As an evolutionary process of urban form or landscape, urban morphology helps us track the trend of urban form development, which is characterized by multi-temporality in terms of data. The increasingly improved multi-temporal data availability, as pushed by the massive advances in geospatial technology, particularly remotely sensed imagery, offers great opportunity for measuring and describing urban morphology. Previous studies have reported the measurement of urban morphology using spatial methods including fractals, landscape matrix and density gradient. However these methods are subject to poor interpretation of urban morphology and low-level understandability to local planners. This paper demonstrates an innovative application of a machine learning method \textendash{} Maxent for analyzing the urban morphology of a fast growing city \textendash{} Wuhan, China. Multi-temporal data sets for 1955, 1965, 1993 and 2000 were processed from remotely sensed imagery. The model results facilitate local planners better to track and interpret the urban form development process of Wuhan city in the past half-century. The paper also illustrates that Maxent is an effective exploratory method and tool for analyzing urban morphology. 1. Introduction Rapid urbanisation has stimulated fast urban growth in Chinese cities and throughout other devel-oping countries (e.g. India and Brazil). Wuhan, a mega city in Central China, has seen its urban built-up areas grow tenfold between 1955 and 2000 (Cheng and Masser 2003a). Urban growth is a continuing process, which means that new buildings, roads, and commercial centers emerge tem-porally accidentally. Understanding temporal dynamics of urban form and urban land cover/land use is a prerequisite to making appropriate sustainable urban development policies and strategies (Cheng and Masser 2004). As an evolutionary process of urban form or landscape, urban mor-phology helps us track the trend of urban form development (Gu 2001, Whitehand and Gu 2006). For example, three classic theories of urban morphology were developed before the 1950s: the concentric zone theory (Burgess 1925), the sector theory (Hoyt 1939) and the multiple nuclei theory (Harris and Ullman 1945). These theories have conceptually defined several},

  abstract = {Cities can be classified according to morphology of their urban structures. Depending on the spatial relations between built-up and empty spaces, blocks and streets (or squares) we can distinguish compact or fragmented cities as well as continuous or discontinuous. The configuration of the physical elements, with their own functional dynamics, produces different "drawings" in the cities. By disaggregating the urban fabric into different components, it is possible to study the topological, geometrical and dimensional relationships between the elements. This paper investigates the morphology of the city of Barcelona; the main objective is to identify and automatically classify morphological homogeneous categories and determine the level of compactness of urban textures. The classification consists of several steps. A first analysis was performed to identify different typologies in the built-up area and typify urban patterns by using geometrical and relational characteristics, such as shape of buildings and spatial interaction between them in terms of distance. This was followed by an automatic classification of urban fabrics with a homogeneous character. Finally, the morphological compactness was determined, calculated as "equilibrium" between size and distances of buildings. In order to make automatic classification of urban textures, we calibrated a set of indicators, capable to describe specific formal and functional characters and, by using GIS and statistical analysis such as factor and cluster analysis, we categorized several homogeneous "morphological neighbourhoods". This classification process is based on geometric characteristics, assuming that, in general, different functions require different forms. By aggregating subjects of similar behaviour we could identify to which kind of urban configuration a neighbourhood possibly belongs. The outcome of this study can support urban planning and management in identifying target areas concerning socio-economic interventions within urbanized territories.},

However, despite extraordinary advancements in evolutionary biology, now being used to explain social and cultural phenomena, a proper science of evolution in cities has never been established since Geddes' work at the dawn of the Town Planning discipline. Commencing in the tradition of Urban Morphology, this research develops and validates a statistically reliable and universally applicable urban taxonomy. The research solidifies existing definitions of built form at the scale of the urban fabric and identifies the constituent elements of form in 40 contemporary UK cities. Quantifiable measurements of these elements allow mathematical descriptions of their organization and mutual relationships. Further, an optimized list of indices with maximum discriminatory potential distinguishes between cases from four historically characterised categories: 1) Historical, 2) Industrial, 3) New Towns, 4) Sprawl. Finally, a dendrogram is produced that shows the tree of similarity between cases, where the great divide between pre and post WWII war urban form is demonstrated. This work shows that: a) it is conceptually sound and viable to measure urban fabric utilizing public, big-data repositories, b) the proposed urban morphometrics system accurately characterises the structure of urban form and clusters cases properly based on their historical origins, c) scientific models of biological evolution can be applied to urban analysis to understand underlying structural similarities.},

  abstract = {The eld of Urban Morphology is a branch of academic research focussing on the study of urban form. Although prior works in this eld had been undertaken earlier, the formal establishment of the discipline of Urban Morphology can be traced back to the establishment of the International Seminar on Urban Form in 1994, and the subsequent Journal of Urban Morphology. The e orts in this eld are found to be largely reliant, from the point of view of methods and de nitions, on two foundational research roots, the Conzenian and the Muratorian processes. Both of these dominant traditions emerged independently in the 1960's. Contemporary works in the eld are found to consistently uphold the status quo within the discipline and fail to challenge or validate the very de nitions of form used so frequently and implicitly in all assessments. This thesis recognises that the eld of Urban Morphology lacks a rigorous lexicon of the urban form, as well as a quantitatively-driven, systematic and comprehensive means of analysing and comparing urban form. A methodology is developed as a systematic, quantitative and comprehensive process of measuring, de ning and classifying urban form. This process entails the study of the measurements of urban form and is termed Urban Morphometrics. Central to Urban Morphometrics is the assignment of rigorous de nitions to the urban elements, called Constituent Urban Elements. A Methodology of measuring these elements and their inter-relationships at the scale of the Sanctuary Area is tested rigorously against Validation, Robustness and Universality criteria, and culminates in the rst taxonomy of urban form. Largely following statistical processes of biological morphometrics, this analysis reveals the relative importance of the various measurements of urban form and derives a minimal set of criteria for measuring urban form. Urban Morphometrics is then integrated into a more typical study of Urban Morphology and later tested to reveal its relevance in professional planning practice. Finally, the classi cation of urban form is used as a platform for discussing the theory of Urban Evolution and the rst bifurcation in the evolutionary pathways of cities, evidenced through the resulting classi cation of urban form.},

  abstract = {Advocates of New Urbanist and neo-traditional planning concepts include street connectivity as a key component for good neighborhood design. Street networks that are more grid-like are preferred over networks that include many cul-de-sacs and long blocks, thus increasing distances between destinations. The increased distances are thought to discourage walking and bicycling and, thus, physical activity. While intuitively attractive, there is limited empirical research at this time making this connection. There is also debate over how to measure connectivity and what levels of connectivity are appropriate. The objective of this research is to evaluate various measures of connectivity for the purpose of increasing walking and bicycling. Measures of connectivity can be useful in two arenas: (1) research linking travel behavior (and perhaps physical activity and health) to urban form; and (2) public policy establishing performance standards for new and/or existing development. This paper first defines and describes a wide range of measures of connectivity, drawn from multiple fields, including transportation, urban planning, geography, and landscape ecology. The paper then includes some preliminary results applying four measures of connectivity to the Portland, Oregon region.},

Then, these primitives form the nodes of a graph where the neighborhood information is obtained through Voronoi tessellation of the image scene. Next, this graph is clustered by thresholding its minimum spanning tree. Finally, the resulting clusters are classified as regular or irregular by examining the distributions of the angles between neighboring nodes. Experiments using Ikonos images show that the application of the proposed model where buildings are used as the primitives and building groups are automatically classified as organized or unorganized can extract valuable information about urban development.},

To this regard the concept of resilience is a powerful lens through which to understand and engage with a changing world. However today resilience is addressed by urban designers only superficially, and an explicit effort to relate elements of urban form to resilience principles is still lacking, representing a great limit for urban designers, as form is their elective medium of intervention in the urban system. As first steps to overcome this gap, we explore in this work the combination of established knowledge in urban morphology and urban design, with knowledge developed in resilience theory and we look at the configuration of, and interdependencies between, different urban elements from the perspective of five proxies of urban form resilience, namely diversity, redundancy, modularity, connectivity and efficiency. After defining each proxy in resilience theory and in relation to urban form, we address them at five different scales which are relevant to urban morphology and urban design: plot, street edge, block, street and sanctuary area / district.},

However, for managing sprawl it seems important to have quantitative descriptors, which allow distinguishing different types of urban patterns and which are less ambiguous than traditional density measures. A better knowledge of the morphology of these patterns should also point to the underlying context of urbanisation at their root. More concretely: to what extent are planned patterns different from less planned ones? Do planned or unplanned patterns show comparable morphological features? The present contribution shows how going back fractal geometry may help to find answers to these questions. A more intuitive introduction to fractal geometry and its application to urban patterns is followed by a definition of the measuring concept used, which helps analysing their morphology. The presentation of a large number of examples helps to understand the information transcribed by these measures and to develop another type of approach to sprawling and less sprawling patterns. Moreover it will indeed be possible to establish links to the planning policy at the root of these patterns. The final topic tackles the question, to what extent knowledge about the form of these patterns may be used for managing urban sprawl in future under the aspect of a more sustainable},

Results for six dimensions are reported for each area, and an initial comparison of the extent of sprawl in the 13 areas is provided. The test confirms the utility of the approach and suggests that a clearer conceptual and operational definition can facilitate research on the causes and consequences of sprawl.},

An analytical characterization and measurement of urban sprawl are required to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon and to propose the possible solutions. Traditional factor analysis techniques, especially Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis, have been commonly used. In this paper, we additionally test Independent Component Analysis with the aim to obtain a multidimensional characterization of the sprawl phenomenon. We also use Bayesian Factor Analysis to obtain a single (unidimensional) measuring index of sprawl, which also allows us to obtain the uncertainty of the inferred index, in contrast to traditional approaches. All these techniques have been applied to study the phenomenon of urban sprawl at the municipality level in Valencia, Spain using a wide set of variables related to the characteristics and patterns of urban land use.},

Drawing from the features of existing street network models that offer disaggregate, scalable and relational analysis of the spatial configuration of urban areas, it presents a multi-modal urban network (MMUN) model that describes an urban environment using three systems \textemdash{} private transport (i.e. car, bicycle and pedestrian), public transport (i.e. rail, tram, metro and bus), and land use. This model offers a unifying framework that allows the use of a range of analysis metrics and conceptions of distance (i.e. physical, topological and cognitive), and aims to be simple and applicable in practice. An implementation of the MMUN is created for the Randstad city- region in the Netherlands. This is analyzed with network centrality measures in a series of experiments, testing its performance against empirical data. The experiments yield conclusions regarding the use of different distance parameters, the choice of network centrality metrics, and the relevant combinations of multi-modal layers to describe the structure and configuration of a city-region},

Most street network models have artificial boundaries, and there are principles that can be applied to minimise or eliminate the effect of the boundary condition. However, the extent of this impact has not been systematically studied and remains little understood. In this article we present an empirical study on the impact of different network model boundaries on the results of closeness and betweenness centrality analysis of street networks. The results demonstrate that the centrality measures are affected differently by the edge effect, and that the same centrality measure is affected differently depending on the type of network distance used. These results highlight the importance, in any study of street networks, of defining the network's boundary in a way that is relevant to the research question, and of selecting appropriate analysis parameters and statistics.},

Evaluating the form of urban fabric is fundamentally important for urban design practice and relevant policy making. However, the quantitative methods and attempts are rare due to the lack of available methods. To address this deficiency, this article presents a GIS-based method to measure the homogeneity of urban fabric by extracting attributes directly from the geometry of 2D building footprints, including the angles between buildings, areas of building footprints, and distances between buildings. These attributes are calculated for separate overlaid grids in the open space between buildings, where each grid holds the measured values for one attribute. We test the method on a prototype, which we applied on four real sites using OpenStreetMap data. The results show how to categorize different kinds of urban fabric based on the new measure},

Although these debates are presumed to have implications for developing worlds as well, systematic comparison of urban forms between developed and developing countries has been lacking. This paper utilized satellite images of 77 metropolitan areas in Asia, US, Europe, Latin America and Australia to calculate seven spatial metrics that capture five distinct dimensions of urban form. Comparison of the spatial metrics was firstly made between developed and developing countries, and then among world regions. A cluster analysis classifies the cities into groups in terms of these spatial metrics. The paper also explored the origins of differences in urban form through comparison with socio-economic developmental indicators and historical trajectories in urban development. The result clearly demonstrates that urban agglomerations of developing world are more compact and dense than their counterparts in either Europe or North America. Moreover, there are also striking differences in urban form across regions. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Remote sensing techniques are now often applied to monitor urbanisation and changes in settlement patterns. In particular, increasing availability of very high resolution imagery ({$<$}1 m spatial resolution) and computing power is enabling complete sets of settlement data in the form of building footprints to be extracted from imagery. These settlement data provide information on the changes occurring in cities, particularly in countries which may lack other data on urbanisation. While spatially detailed, extracted building footprints typically lack other information that identify building types or can be used to differentiate intraurban land uses or neighbourhood types. This work demonstrates an approach to classifying settlement types through multi-scale spatial patterns of urban morphology visible in building footprint data extracted from very high resolution imagery. The work uses a Gaussian mixture modelling approach to select and hierarchically merge components into clusters. The results are maps classifying settlement types on a high spatial resolution (100 m) grid. The approach is applied in Kaduna, Nigeria; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo; and Maputo, Mozambique and demonstrates the potential of computational methods to take advantage of large spatial datasets and extract meaningful information to support monitoring of urban areas. The model-based approach produces a hierarchy of potential clustering solutions, and we suggest that this can be used in partnership with local knowledge of the context when creating settlement typologies.},

Although there has been considerable amount of CA-based modeling work reported in the literature, few have been used as actual planning or policy making tools. The goal of this research aims to address the problem of ``unapplicable CA models'' by combining CA models with the framework of geodesign. Inspired by Batty's new science of cities, we put forward a geodesign-based framework for CA modeling to integrate the positive and normative dimension of the new science of cities as envisioned by Batty. Instead of merely applying CA models to positive urban studies, which typically requires more accurate predictions, we advocate the integration of positive (i.e. urban simulation) and normative (i.e. design) city science via the application of CA modeling to geodesign. By linking CA simulation with the geodesign framework, a geodesign-based CA model is developed and six urban design scenarios are integrated into the model, to test the urban growth impacts of these scenarios and generate a new design scenario accordingly. Using a case study of urban growth in Changping District, Beijing, we demonstrate that the normative and the positive dimension of Batty's new science for cities can be integrated. Geodesign, as a new conceptual framework, is helpful for streamlining the CA modelling process to evaluate different design scenarios and design new scenarios. In return, CA models could also contribute to the geodesign process by offering a tool for simulating and evaluating impacts of different design scenarios on urban growth.},

  abstract = {There is a lack of clarity in urban morphology in the use of the terms `plot' and `lot'. The complications arise in large part because these terms are used to refer to several things. Further ambiguities arise because the concept of property is not univocal, and the boundaries corresponding to the different meanings of plot do not necessarily coincide. An attendant problem is that distinct aspects of urban form are conflated into a single, ill-d\- efined entity. Given the significance of the plot in building typology and urban morphology, the ambiguities in its definition raise questions about the role of the plot in the generation and transformation of urban form and in particular in the central phenomenon of persistence and the differential rates of change between street pattern, plot pattern and building pattern. The aim of this paper is therefore to clarify the terms plot and lot by examining the pertinent characteristics that are used to define them and the underlying relationships and logic they entail. The resolution offered in conclusion is that the fundamental basis for defining a plot is rooted in human behaviour and our interactions with both our environment and each other. This may then provide a fruitful basis for investigating the phenomenon of persistence in more detail.},

  abstract = {Building generalization is a difficult operation due to the complexity of the spatial distribution of buildings and for reasons of spatial recognition. In this study, building generalization is decomposed into two steps, i.e. building grouping and generalization execution. The neighbourhood model in urban morphology provides global constraints for guiding the global partitioning of building sets on the whole map by means of roads and rivers, by which enclaves, blocks, superblocks or neighbourhoods are formed; whereas the local constraints from Gestalt principles provide criteria for the further grouping of enclaves, blocks, superblocks and/or neighbourhoods. In the grouping process, graph theory, Delaunay triangulation and the Voronoi diagram are employed as supporting techniques. After grouping, some useful information, such as the sum of the building's area, the mean separation and the standard deviation of the separation of buildings, is attached to each group. By means of the attached information, an appropriate operation is selected to generalize the corresponding groups. Indeed, the methodology described brings together a number of welldeveloped theories/techniques, including graph theory, Delaunay triangulation, the Voronoi diagram, urban morphology and Gestalt theory, in such a way that multiscale products can be derived.},

We use the conditional probability distribution of shape factor of blocks with a given area, and define what could constitute the `fingerprint' of a city. Using a simple hierarchical clustering method, these fingerprints can then serve as a basis for a typology of cities. We apply this method to a set of 131 cities in the world, and at an intermediate level of the dendrogram, we observe 4 large families of cities characterized by different abundances of blocks of a certain area and shape. At a lower level of the classification, we find that most European cities and American cities in our sample fall in their own sub-category, highlighting quantitatively the differences between the typical layouts of cities in both regions. We also show with the example of New York and its different Boroughs, that the fingerprint of a city can be seen as the sum of the ones characterising the different neighbourhoods inside a city. This method provides a quantitative comparison of urban street patterns, which could be helpful for a better understanding of the causes and mechanisms behind their distinct shapes.

This paper compares eighteen metrics of urban form for 542 neighborhoods in Salt Lake County, Utah. The comparison was made in the context of characterizing three neighborhood types from different time periods: pre-suburban (1891\textendash 1944), suburban (1945\textendash 1990), and late-suburban (1990\textendash 2007). We used correlation analysis, within and across time periods, to assess each metric's ability to uniquely character-ize urban form; and we used linear regression to assess the ability to distinguish neighborhood type. Three of the metrics show redundancy and two did not capture differences in urban form for the case study. Based on our findings, we recommend thirteen of the eighteen metrics for planners and policy ana-lysts who want to quantify urban form using spatial data that are commonly available. Furthermore, our case study shows that despite policy efforts to encourage ''smart growth,'' urban neighborhoods in Salt Lake County continue to exhibit characteristics of ''sprawl.'' These findings suggest the effectiveness of smart growth policies in Salt Lake County have had limited effect.},

  abstract = {Although space syntax is often presented as a configurational theory of architecture, this tends to hide the more fundamental claim that it is also an analytical theory, a theory based on analytical science rather than on the normative or ideological claims normally found in architectural theory. This article proposes an extension of such an analytical theory in the context of urbanism by using space syntax areas in urban morphology that earlier have not been directly part of space syntax analysis. If one allows for some simplification, one can say that the main variable of urban form analysed in space syntax is accessibility. This article introduces two other variables: density and diversity. Density, the dominating variable in geographic analysis of urban space, is fundamental for the development of knowledge about urban space and in the practice of urban planning. Diversity, at least since Jane Jacob's writing of The Death and Life of Great American Cities, has been another focus for urban analysis and urban planners, yet one that has proven to be more difficult to address. A study of an urban area in Stockholm identified three convincing correlations: 1.) a correlation between integration and movement; 2.) a correlation between accessible building density and popu- lation; and 3.) a correlation between accessible plots and diversity indices such as number of age groups and lines of businesses. Whereas the first correlation is not very surprising in the context of space syntax research and the second correlation is interesting mostly because of its original measur- ing technique, the third correlation must be considered surprising and an original finding. The present study proposes that the three ways to measure the three variables accessibility, density and diversity could be combined into a more general analytical theory of urban form, directly stem- ming from space syntax analysis, significantly widening the scope of space syntax into a more gen- eral urban morphology. In addition, it is proposed that these measurements capture something that can be called spatial capital, that also can engage adjacent scientific disciplines.},

One school of thought suggests that the nucleus should be located along the busiest thoroughfares; a second school holds that it must be some distance away from them \textendash{} which, because of their disruptiveness, should form the edge of the neighborhood; and a third school proposes that it should be somewhere between the two as an `eccentric nucleus'. The three schools may be overlooking the underlying variables that govern this problem under different conditions, and so we propose a model for establishing the best location and distribution of urban nuclei as these conditions vary. This requires firstly, a redefinition of the `neighborhood' as distinguished from a `pedestrian shed'. We argue that a `neighborhood' can either emerge within a `sanctuary area' between thoroughfares, or span across both `sanctuary areas' and thoroughfares, if the latter are properly designed; a `pedestrian shed', by contrast, can overlap with neighborhoods and with other pedestrian sheds.We propose a `400 meter rule', a surprisingly small maximum spacing of main thoroughfares that empirical observation shows that traditional, pedestrian- governed urban fabric has always tended to obey, for reasons that are likely to have to do with the self- organizing logic of pedestrian movement and social activity. In so doing, we advance a more fine-grained, permeable, potentially lower-carbon model and illustrate its advantages with several historic and modern examples. URBAN},

  abstract = {With a tradition of compact cities, generally strict planning controls, and variable growth rates, many cities in Europe have policies which aim to restrict low density growth patterns. However, there is clear evidence that low density growth is happening, and that it is essential to understand the nature, location, and extent of the urban forms emerging on the periphery of cities across Europe. In its extreme manifestation, such low density peripheral growth is labelled as sprawl and considered detrimental. Drawing on the extensive literature on defining and measuring urban form, we focus on the methodologies and measures applied in the European studies at the regional (metropolitan), city, and community level. Affirming that the assessment of urban form at the community level is undertaken only sporadically, we adapt the measures used by Knaap et al. (2007) in studying US urban form to explore their applicability and robustness in analysing the evolution of urban form in a European setting. We examine the change of urban form in the Dublin Region (Ireland) in terms of residential and commercial density, internal and external connectivity, and land use mix. We find that the measures used, when adjusted to meet availability and nature of local data, are strong in revealing the trends in urban development form. We conclude by discussing the significance of the trends revealed in the case of Dublin and point to the issues of data availability in terms of both spatial and temporal resolution. Finally, we speculate on how the measures at different scales are suited to inform different types of urban policies and planning approaches.},

In order to monitor changes in the urban environment, an understanding of the change in patterns of urban development over time is becoming increasingly important. The objective of this study is to explore an approach for combining remote sensing and spatial metrics to monitor urbanization, and investigate the relationship between urbanization and urban land use plans. The study areas, consisting of the cities of Hanoi, Hartford, Nagoya and Shanghai, were examined using Landsat and ASTER data from 1975 to 2003. In this study a program based on the PLADJ spatial metric was undertaken to produce urban growth maps. Then, FRAGSTATS was used to evaluate the characteristics of urban composition. The results showed that the urban core of Nagoya changed moderately over time. Shanghai had a high population density, and satellite towns absorbed potential suburban development. Hartford exhibited a spread out pattern of urban development with a high concentration of settlement in the suburb. Conversely, the new urban areas of Hanoi developed rapidly along major transportation routes, resulting in urban development in Hanoi assuming an unusual pattern. The combined approach of remote sensing and spatial metrics provides local city planners with valuable information that can be used to better understand the impacts of urban planning policies in urban areas, particularly in Hanoi. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The study of centrality in complex systems,however, originated in other scientific areas, namely in structural sociology, well before its use in urban studies; moreover, as a structural property of the system, centrality has never been extensively investigated metrically in geographic networks as it has been topologically in a wide range of other relational networks like social, biological or technological. After two previous works on some structural properties of the dual and primal graph representations of urban street networks (Porta et al. cond-mat/0411241; Crucitti et al. physics/0504163), in this paper we provide an in-depth investigation of centrality in the primal approach as compared to the dual one, with a special focus on potentials for urban design.},

Some of us have recently argued that what we still miss is the serious consideration of the factor of time in urbanism, or, in other words, a deeper ?time-conscious? approach (Thwaites, Porta, Romice, \textbackslash\& Greaves, 2008). Inevitably, that means focusing on change as the essential dynamic of evolution in the built environment, which in turn leads to re-addressing concepts like control, self-organization and community participation. After time and change have been finally firmly placed at the centre stage, the whole discipline of urban planning and design, its conceptual equipment as well as its operational toolbox, reveals its weaknesses under a new light and calls for the construction of a different scenario. This paper poses the problem of this scenario in disciplinary terms, it argues about its premises and outlines its essential features. The scope of this paper is not to deliver a comprehensive model for a new approach to urban planning and design, but to set the right framework and rise the right questions so that we can start thinking of issues such as urban regeneration, informal settlements and massive urbanization, community participation and representation, beauty and humanity in space, in a different way.},

Improvements include the addition of sidewalks and access pathways to isolated cul-de-sacs to make for shorter and more direct routes.

The question for the researcher is which attributes are most useful to reflect characteristics of urban morphology and how can they be processed from the given data. In this paper, we want to address this issue and give an overview of quantitative descriptions of urban morphology. We base our work on a data model that is simple enough to allow for reproducibility in any study area.

While we find a growing number of quantitative spatial models such as hedonic price models, location choice models, or applied machine learning algorithms, characteristics describing the urban morphology are still rarely reported in these. One reason can be found in the limited knowledge on how to characterize the urban morphology best. In this chapter, we address this deficit and define attributes that are suitable to characterize the urban morphology in quantitative means at different scales. We show how these can be processed from a data model that is simple enough to allow for reproducibility in most study areas and process them for the case study of Switzerland. Finally, we use the attributes to define urban typologies through clustering methods. These are compared on their outcome, their consistency, and interpretation.},

The method entails the adoption of quantitative descriptions of individual street-patterns and of classification algorithms, in order to obtain numerically defined typomorphologies, which may then be statistically associated with the numerical outputs of street-network analysis. We apply the method to the case of Oporto Metropolitan Area, whose development we observed over 60 years. We isolate each increment of development entailing the creation of new streets (4208 objects), we quantify the morphology of their street-layouts, and we classify them into typomorphologies with clustering techniques. Through the investigation of the temporal and spatial frequencies of those typomorphologies, we assess their impacts on the street-networks of a set of selected civil-parishes of the metropolitan region, demonstrating that different typomorphological frequencies result in also different global street-network properties. We conclude by summarising the advantages of the method to generic urban morphological research and by suggesting that it may also contribute to inform bottom-up metropolitan spatial planning.},

  abstract = {Robust quantitative descriptions of the social and physical characteristics of urban contexts are essential for assessing the impacts of urban environments on other, potentially dependent variables. Common methodologies used for that purpose, however, are either coarse or suffer from biasing effects. At the social level, the use of indicators encoded into pre-defined areal units, makes results prone to the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. At the physical level, the adopted morphological indicators are usually highly aggregated descriptors of urban form. Moreover, there is a lack of explicit methodologies for the purposive sampling of urban contexts with specific combinations of social and physical characteristics, which\textemdash we argue\textemdash may be more effective than probabilistic sampling, when exploring phenomena as elusive as the effects of urban contextual factors. This article presents a set of GIS-based methods for addressing these issues, based on: a) local indicators of spatial association; b) detailed quantitative morphological descriptions, coupled with unsupervised classification techniques; and c) purposive sampling strategies carried out on the data generated by the proposed context characterization methods (a and b). The methods are illustrated through the characterization of the urban contexts of the 77 state-sector secondary schools in Liverpool, but are generalizable across all categories of urban objects and are independent of the geographical context of implementation.},

It is the first comparative analysis of a system of rapidly developing cities with landscape pattern metrics. Using ten classified Landsat Thematic Mapper images acquired from 1988 to 1999, we quantify the annual rate of urban land-use change for four cities in southern China. The classified images were used to generate annual maps of urban extent, and landscape metrics were calculated and analyzed spatiotemporally across three buffer zones for each city for each year. The study shows that for comprehensive understanding of the shapes and trajectories of urban expansion, a spatiotemporal landscape metrics analysis across buffer zones is an improvement over using only urban growth rates. This type of analysis can also be used to infer underlying social, economic, and political processes that drive the observed urban forms. The results indicate that urban form can be quite malleable over relatively short periods of time. Despite different economic development and policy histories, the four cities exhibit common patterns in their shape, size, and growth rates, suggesting a convergence toward a standard urban form.},

  abstract = {Research on urban form and walkability suggests that on average smaller blocks are better for pedestrians. We explore how block sizes, plot dimensions and street widths affect pedestrian accessibility in regular grids. Pedestrian accessibility is captured by the gravity index, which is proportional to the number of neighbouring plots that can be reached within a given walking radius and inversely proportional to the travel costs involved. Pedestrian accessibility is measured for the original town plans of well-known US and Australian grids and compared with thousands of computer simulated grids, analysing how close the grids come to the theoretical maxima of pedestrian accessibility, given plot sizes and street dimensions. The findings show how dimensions of plot frontages and depths, street widths and block lengths affect pedestrian accessibility in gridiron urban environments. Block lengths have a non-linear relationship to accessibility and smaller blocks are not necessarily better for pedestrians. In many cases, larger blocks have greater pedestrian accessibility than smaller blocks, which might explain previous variable findings on the effects of blocks sizes on walkability. Though block lengths in most of the famous grids we investigate come close to achieving maximum possible pedestrian accessibility levels, some of them could provide users with as much as 12 per cent more accessibility if their lengths were optimized for pedestrians. The lengths of the Manhattan and Indianapolis blocks come closest to maximizing pedestrian access, given their original plot and street dimensions. We illustrate a few prototypical block sizes that maximize pedestrian accessibility and may be suitable for pedestrian-friendly subdivisions in contemporary urban planning.},

Buffers of different sizes (1. km, 3. km, 5. km, and 8. km, respectively) are drawn around each resident's location as the unit of analysis. For the four sets of 20,467 neighborhood environments, 27 neighborhood form metrics are selected, computed, and further reduced through factor analysis. The results suggest that the derived subsets of univariate metrics can be applied across neighborhood types to characterize diverse neighborhood environments. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Four quantitative variables are developed to measure four dimensions of urban form at the metropolitan level: metropolitan size, activity intensity, the degree that activities are evenly distributed, and the extent that high-density sub-areas are clustered. Through a series of simulation analyses, the global Moran coefficient, which characterises the fourth dimension, distinguishes compactness from sprawl. It is high, intermediate and close to zero for monocentric, polycentric and decentralised sprawling forms respectively. In addition, the more there is more local sprawl, composed of discontinuity and strip development, the lower is the Moran coefficient.},
