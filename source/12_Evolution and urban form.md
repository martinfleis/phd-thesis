## Learning from biology
*morphometrics and numerical taxonomy as two concepts which may allow overcoming issues identified in previous two chapters*

### Morphometrics as a descriptive tool
*short introduction*
*morphometrics as a descriptive tool*
*description of the principles and applications (TBD)*
==missing contents, research to be done==

- traditional morphometrics
- geometric morphometrics
- outline analysis
- tissue morphometrics (Histomorphometry)
- other fields

### Numerical taxonomy as a classification tool
*what is it*

#### Principles of numerical taxonomy
*base this on Sneath and Sokal*

##### Operational Taxonomic Unit

##### Taxonomic characters

##### Taxonomic resemblance

##### Taxonomic structure

### Criticism of morphometrics and numerical taxonomy
*based on literature, not mine :)*

## Transferability of concepts into urban morphology

### Review of principles and their applicability
#### Morphometrics

#### Taxonomy

##### Principles
###### Operational Taxonomic Unit
*OTU could be â€¦*
*direct link to chapter 2*

###### Taxonomic characters
*direct link to chapter 3*

###### Taxonomic resemblance and structure
*==pick methods from literature==*


### Critical assessment of preceding work

*Proposed further research*
- case study expansion
	- he wanted more SA's I argue that it needs to be able to analyse whole fabric
- metrics expansion
	- completely agree
- challenging SA

#### Sanctuary area as OTU
*non-homogeneity of SA*

#### Selection of taxonomic characters
*collinearity of characters*

#### Limitation of the model
*missing some aspects*



### Unresolved questions
- OTU
- model
- characters

### sum up
*conclude Dibble*

## Conclusions
