# Numerical taxonomy & ecological perspective

* Evolutionary perspective in the context of urban design
    * Biological as well as cultural
    * Taxonomy

- Explain the principles of evolution in the context of urban morphology
- deifne viable analogies
- use cultural evolution alongside with biological
- introduce evolutionary approach to classification - cladistics, taxonomy
- current views of evolution and cities (e.g. Marshall)

## Numerical taxonomy in biology

### Origins of numerical taxonomy and morphometrics

### Morphometrics in the age of DNA sequencing

### Criticism of morphometrics and numerical taxonomy
*based on literature, not mine :)*

## Parallels between biological science and urban morphology (based on EEPUM)
*Reiterating the discussion we had during three EEPUM workshops focusing on the question of finding parallel concepts between biology and UM, specifically aimed at the question what is the individual.*
### Flexible parallel

### The case of individual

## Transferability of concept of numerical taxonomy into urban morphology

### Review of principles and their applicability

### Critical assessment of Jacob Dibble's work

### City as a community (based on EEPUM)
*Discussion on the ecological community-based science applied to urban form as a possible way forward, if we are able to define communities and their composition.*

### application of ecological perspective on the concept of a city as a complex adaptive system

## Conclusions
