# Urban morphometrics and its terminological inconsistency

==rewrite paper -> thesis==

==_link back_==


In the age of urbanisation, urban planning and design still struggle to offer reliable models to address the challenges of the 21st century [@cuthbert2007urban; @romice2020masterplanning], while the discipline’s shift towards an evidence-based approach and a “new science of cities” is still in its infancy [@batty2012, p.S15]. Despite remarkable growth and progress, urban morphology (UM)—the area of urban studies that focuses on cities’ physical form, its patterns of change in time and relations with non-spatial dynamics—is no exception. In particular, two issues still hinder a quantitative approach to the analysis of urban form: first, the availability, quality and consistency of data across geographical regions; second, the discipline’s inherent difficulties to offer a rigorous and consistent definition of urban form, its fundamental components and the relationships between them. This paper offers a contribution towards the resolution of this second problem.

_aim of the chapter_
The high variety of measurable urban form characters, defined as *a characteristic (or feature) of one kind of urban form that distinguishes it from another kind* [adapted from @dibble2017; @sneath1973], used in urban morphology literature is fragmented across numerous unrelated sources, and despite several attempts to systematise it, [@larkham1991glossary; @caniggia2001architectural; @conzen2004thinking; @dibble2017] a comprehensive overview is still lacking. This gap of knowledge creates uncertainty as to which research areas are covered and which need further research. Moreover, terminology is not consistent nor univocal, resulting in weaker methodological compatibility and higher hurdles in comparing research outputs. According to @whitehand2012,

> “comparative research is faced with a plethora of case studies that use different, or sometimes unspecified, definitions. […] In addition to problems of non-comparability of definitions, methods and concepts, differences between the sources of information employed need to be overcome” (p.60).

_structure of the chapter_
In this paper we: a) propose a coherent and comprehensive classification system of measurable urban form characters, and b) use this system to resolve current inconsistencies and redundancies and identify areas of weakness in existing literature. This work is meant to be preparatory to the future exploration of how to measure urban form in a way that is comprehensive, systematic and replicable.

## Selection and systematisation of methods and characters

In this section we present: 1) the criteria utilised to select relevant literature used to map the field of UM; 2) the process of systematization of such literature, which we then use to 3) identify, cross-compare, (re)define and 4) the re-classify urban form characters.

As for our own terminology, terms such as “attribute”, “variable”, “measurement”, “metric”, “index”, “character”, “indicator” or “proxy” are often used interchangeably in urban morphology to signify the measurable feature of an object [@araldi2019; @bobkova2017; @dibble2017; @schirmer2015; @vanderhaegen2017]. In this paper we follow @dibble2017 where the term “character” defines “*a characteristic (or feature) of one kind of organism that will distinguish it from another kind*” @sneath1973. Here, however, “organism” refers to a distinct kind or type of urban form.  “Urban form” as a term has been used to loosely signify different aspects of space’s configuration in cities along with its use and agents, and is therefore a polysemic term, while in this work we refer exclusively to the physical components of urban space, i.e. the built-up fabric (blocks, streets, buildings…) and its fundamental spatial subdivision (plots) after @moudon1997.

### Literature selection and systematisation
To review the literature (figure \ref{fig:selection}), we selected sources that: a) explicitly undertake a *quantitative* examination of urban form characters\footnote{In some cases, the research focused both on physical and non-physical characteristics and was therefore included but only the physical part of the method was used in our analysis.}; b) include urban form characters that are not present in already selected sources, to avoid unnecessary duplication and overlapping.

First, we looked at papers published in two leading journals of urban analytics and morphology: “Environment and Planning B” and “Urban Morphology”. From here, we extracted keywords, which we then used to identify a number of academic citation databases (Google Scholar, Scopus, Mendeley Search, ResearchGate, Taylor and Francis Online) and then undertook a wider snowballing exploration. The process of keyword search and snowballing was iterated whenever new inputs were found and adopted to ensures that the selection is rigorous and inclusive.

![Scheme of the process of selection of literature and its usage.](source/figures/ch3/selection.pdf "Scheme of the process of selection of literature and its usage"){#fig:selection width=90%}

All selected papers were then classified according to: a) grain, i.e. the scale (size) of *the basic spatial unit* on which descriptors are calculated; b) extent, i.e. the scale (coverage) of *the case study*; c) purpose; d) potential comprehensiveness, i.e. the number of urban form characters measured;  e) timeframe, whether *synchronic* (comparing different cases at the same time) or *diachronic* (comparing the same case at different times). 

==ADD LINKS WITH CHAPTER 2==

For *grain*, we considered the basic spatial unit as the smallest element being measured, while for *extent*, we considered coverage as the total area of the case study analysed. Both are taken into account and then organised  from 1 (small) to 10 (large)\footnote{This classification is based on conceptual ranking rather than metric size: the building scale is smaller than the plot scale, in that the former is conceptually contained in the latter, even though in terms of sheer size some buildings may be larger than some plots.}. 

### Classification of characters
We then extracted individual urban form characters from the sources classified as above. Those influenced by non-morphological data, such as distance to the nearest bus stop [@song2007] or land use [@dibble2017], were excluded. 

To overcome terminological inconsistencies among the urban form characters adopted in different studies\footnote{This phenomenon, occurring when the same urban form characters are presented under different names or different urban form characters under the same name, we call nicknaming.}, we comprehensively redefined them (see Section 4). On these new definitions, we then designed a classification framework of such characters, based on their nature and the spatial unit they belong to. Finally, we tested such framework in the classification of all urban form characters initially extracted from literature, discussed the emerging gaps and redundancies and suggested further developments.

## A state of art

While the existing literature on urban morphology shows a historical
inclination towards qualitative methods [@dibble2015], through
the iterative literature review process illustrated above we identified
72 predominantly *quantitative* works (peer-reviewed articles,
conference papers, book chapters, PhD theses). In figure \ref{fig:scale_diagram}, selected
literature items are *positioned* according to their grain and extent
scales, and *classified* by their purpose (colour), and number of urban
form characters considered (size).

### Patterns of research

Quantitative analysis in urban morphology appears to have three distinct research purposes in particular: to enable comparison among cases, to measure the performance of urban form and to monitor or predict urban growth. *Comparison* is the largest group containing 45 out of the 72 selected works (62%), and is significantly synchronic (95%). It includes studies which cover a range of urban form characters from one only [@agryzcov2017; @ariza-villaverde2013; @batty1987; @frankhauser2004; @thomas2010] to many [@dibble2015; @dibble2017]; however, those covering more than 10 urban form characters are only the 33%, and those with more than 25 the 15%, demonstrating a lack of comprehensiveness in literature. In terms of scales, comparative studies tend to be lower in grain scale (more detailed) and higher in extent scale (larger case studies). 

Papers measuring *performance* refer in particular to one specific aspect of urban form, such as sustainability [@bourdic2012; @haggag2002], resilience [@feliciotti2016], urbanity [@oliveira2013], or network-based accessibility [@krizek2003; @sevtsuk2016]. Similar to the comparison group, the majority of works in this second group is synchronic. However, unlike comparative studies, they tend to use similar scales for both grain and extent.

Not surprisingly, studies on urban *growth* are mostly diachronic. Many publications in this group focus on the analysis of urban sprawl [@galster2001; @song2004] to capture sprawl indices [@gielen2017]; here data are often aggregated and classified in a built-unbuilt binary framework [@galster2001; @seto2005], enriched by Cellular Automaton [@batty1997; @kong2016] or machine learning [@cheng2011] techniques. As growth is measured mostly at metropolitan scale, with a few exceptions [@hallowell2013] all works focus on large scale of extent, while mostly using the same scale of grain.

Crucial for the success of a comparative method is *complexity*. This is represented by both the cross-scale extent of the research, as reflected for example in the work of @song2007, later refined by @song2013 or @schirmer2015\footnote{In the figure 2, cross-scale research is listed at all relevant scales (as @schirmer2015).}, and the number of urban form characters measured (potential comprehensiveness). Still, over the whole set of 72 literature items selected, those measuring a number of urban form characters large enough to minimise biases and errors (i.e. > 25 urban form characters) is relatively rare (15%). Only recently, a few such comprehensive studies started to emerge [@bourdic2012; @dibble2017; @ewing2006; @oliveira2013; @schirmer2015], contributing to the growing area of urban morphometrics [@carneiro2010; @dibble2017; @feliciotti2017]. However, the sheer number of urban form characters scrutinised (comprehensiveness) does not necessarily ensure complexity, as many of them may be collinear and hence capture the same information.

### Nomenclature
The review of the 72 quantitative studies illustrated above produced a list of 465 individual measurable urban form characters: of these, many were duplicated or hidden under the same name (“nicknaming”), suggesting the persistence of significant nicknaming even in the quantitative area of urban morphology analysis. For example, the term “connectivity” is in some cases used to signify a broader group of urban form characters (usually related to network analysis) [@dibble2017], while in other cases is attributed to one single one of them, an yet with different meanings [@hillier1996; @lowry2014]; in some instances the term is used in both ways in the same study [@bourdic2012]. 

Hence, we undertook a process of "character redefinition", and
introduced the "*Index of Element*" aimed at achieving a higher degree
of consistency between the name of urban form characters and their
*substance*. This index essentially defines each urban form character
according to *the measure that it calculates* (the *Index*) and *the
element of urban form that it measures* (the *Element*). If we consider
the "connectivity" of the pedestrian grid in @bourdic2012 for example, we can easily distinguish the measure being
calculated (Index), which is a *weighted number of intersections*, and
the "thing" the urban form character of which is calculated *(Element)*,
which is the *pedestrian network*. This brings us to redefine the
measure as *"Weighted Number of Intersections of Pedestrian Network \"*,
leaving much narrower room for interpretation. The use of a rigorous
terminological criterium such as the Index of Elements is, even in
quantitative urban morphology analysis, still occasional, though not
absent [@schirmer2015]. The Index of Element helps achieve
an understandable definition of urban form characters *by their same*
*name*: the *Index* part of the name captures the nature of the measure,
independently from what is measured, while the *Element* part of the
name captures the nature of what is measured, independently from how it
is measured. Urban form characters defined by the combination of the two
become consistently understandable and comparable across different
methods. Application of this method on 465 identified urban form
characters led to the elimination of 104 cases of duplication (22.4%),
leaving 361 uniquely defined ones.

Table: Examples of Index of Element conversions. In some cases, urban
form character's redefinitions bring in crucial information about the
urban form character, in others only minor change. However, adding
*Element* into the urban form character's name helps developing
quantitative urban morphology by making it more intelligible, hence
comparable.

### Classification
Having tackled the terminology issue, we developed a typology of urban
form characters directly based on their name (which now captures their
definition). This is a *"concept-based classification",* i.e. one
*"which conceptually separates a given set of items multidimensionally.
... the key characteristic of a typology is that its dimensions
represent concepts rather than empirical cases"* [@smith2002, p.381]. In this sense, by examining the urban form characters' names we
classify them along three dimensions: 1) the nature of the *Index,* 2)
the scale of the *grain* of the character, and 3) the scale of the
*Element*'s extent*.*

While most authors classify their observed urban form characters in
groups, which are usually case-specific, these classifications vary.
Generally, we can identify two approaches : one refers to the urban form
character's scale, as for example the sequence *Object*, *Composition,*
*Neighbourhood*, *District*, *Municipality* and *Region* in @schirmer2015; the second refers to the *Element'*s *nature*, as for
example in @song2013 *Permeability*, *Vitality*,
*Variety*, or equally in @bourdic2012 *Intensity,
Distribution, Proximity, Connectivity, Complexity, Diversity, Form*. We
propose that the first step in the classification of urban form
characters follows the nature of the measure itself, which is captured
in the *Index* part of its *Name*. On this ground, we build on @bourdic2012 classification, adapting it to reflect the
needs of a general analysis of urban form\footnote{Research of @bourdic2012 focuses on measuring urban sustainability, and one of the categories is defined as ‘form’ which we feel obligated to refine into ‘dimension’ and ‘shape’, while ‘proximity’ is excluded as it is referring to non-morphological elements.}.

Hence, we firstly distinguished in the *Index* six categories that are
*ontological* (they express the nature of the Index): *1. Dimension, 2.
Shape, 3. Spatial distribution, 4. Intensity, 5. Connectivity, and 6.
Diversity*. These six categories are in a ranked order from the simplest
(*1.* *Dimension*) to the most complex (*6.* *Diversity*). For example,
*"Weighted Number of Intersections of Pedestrian Network"*, where the
term *"Weighted Number of Intersections"* is the *Index* and
*"Pedestrian Network"* is the *Element* will be classified as a urban
form character of Index category *"4. Intensity"*. The six categories
are not purely independent, as we can identify functional relationships
between them. Often urban form characters in latter groups are
mathematically dependent on others in the former: for example, those
indexed by *Elongation*, which fall in the *"2. Shape"* category, are
functionally dependent on those indexed by *Width* and *Length*, which
fall into *"1. Dimension"*, since *Elongation* = *Width/Length* ratio.
Also, we classify the urban form character into three categories that
capture its *grain*-- the scale of the spatial unit in which the unique
value is stored. Finally, we distinguish in the *Element* three
categories that are *descriptive* of the scale at which the element
itself occurs (equivalent of scale of spatial extent in figure 2), is
observable and measurable in urban morphology.

Since many measurable urban form characters in literature work at
multiple scales, in our classification we need to maintain a certain
level of breadth in defining the amplitude of scale. Therefore, we are
proposing three *conceptual* levels of scale only: Small (S)
representing the spatial extent of building, plot, street or block (and
similar), Medium (M) representing the scale of the sanctuary area
[@mehaffy2010], neighbourhood, walkable distance (5 or 10
minutes) or district (and similar) and Large (L), representing the city,
urban area, metropolitan area or similar. Thus, to continue with our
example, the urban form character "*Weighted Number of Intersections of
Pedestrian Network*", would be classified based on 1) its
grain, and 2) the *scale* of its *Element* "Pedestrian Network". In this
case, networks as physical entities occur and have meaning, and
therefore can be observed and measured at the larger (M, L) scales,
while they do mean very little at the small scale. Because the network
in this case refers solely to pedestrian use, the urban form character
falls into the category M of scale, or alternatively M/L if we allow
more flexible cross-scale definition which might be desirable in
general, as it softens the hard boundaries which might not be applicable
to some, accounting for the authors' specific conceptualisation of
spatial scale (such as Space Syntax). As this urban form character
measures a single number per network, the scale of its grain and that of
the extent of its *Element* coincide. However, that it not the case in
all situations: for example, *Closeness Centrality of Street Network* is
measured on the larger network (M, L scales), while the value is
specific for each node (S scale)\footnote{Note that the extent in section 3 refers to the whole method used in each paper, in this section it refers to the spatial extent of single character only. The two concepts of extent are not the same.}.

The resulting typology offers an unambiguous identification of each urban form character based on its very nature, as reflected in its name (table \ref{tab:uf_chars}).

## Interpretation
The summative statistics of the complete Table of Urban Form Characters offers in-depth information into the current state of how terminology is defined and used in the field. 

### Distribution of characters
The distribution of urban form characters
across the scales of extent shows a slight decline as we proceed from
Small to Large scales, but the distribution is relatively balanced
(figure \ref{fig:totals}b). In terms of the scale of grain, it is naturally skewed
towards Small scale (figure \ref{fig:totals}a). The situation changes if we explore the
distribution of urban form characters among the 6 different categories
established at the start of our classification. In this case, *spatial
distribution* and *diversity* are underrepresented (with respectively 27
and 13 urban form characters), while all other categories each contain
relatively high numbers each (from 55 in *connectivity* to 115 in
*intensity*) (figure \ref{fig:totals}c). One of the reasons for this distribution is
that *dimension, shape, intensity* and *connectivity* are much easier to
capture than *spatial distribution* or *diversity* and their urban form
characters are simpler to define.

![Number of urban form characters per scale of grain (a), scale of the extent (b), number of characters per category (c). Note that some characters are present at multiple scales.](source/figures/ch3/totals.pdf "Number of urban form characters"){#fig:totals width=100%}

To understand the distribution of urban form characters in better
intra-category detail, we used decomposed statistics (fig \ref{fig:divided}), which
helped understand the relationship between categories and both
definitions of scales. *Dimension* and *shape* categories tend to be
significantly more present at the Small scale, from both perspectives.
At this scale, physical features tend to be more precisely defined,
hence it is natural that their dimensions and shapes are measured at the
same scale. On the other side is *connectivity*, being present
exclusively at larger scales (M, L) of extent, but being skewed towards
smaller scales of grain. This is an inherent consequence of the nature
of this urban form character which is typical of networks, easier to
identify at larger scales of the environment in which they are observed,
while the values are often unique for each components of network (as
mentioned above).

![Number of urban form characters per each scale decomposed to each category. Note that some urban form characters are present at multiple scales.](source/figures/ch3/divided.pdf "Number of urban form characters"){#fig:divided width=100%}

The overview of urban form characters shows some clear recurring
patterns from the perspective of (both) scales as well: it is worth
noting that complex urban form characters are more likely to be measured
at larger scales of extent (M, L). This seems to be partially caused by
the nature of our classification system, where the limited amount of
data inputs at a small scale makes results for more compound and
aggregated urban form characters less reliable. However, at the same
time, this pattern is posing the question of whether information is
being missed out in this overview. Not even one of the six categories
shows a balance coverage of all three scales (for both grain and
extent). We can question which parts of the classification are less
comprehensive for a logical reason (smaller scales are not suitable for
complex relational urban form characters) and which are so just because
some may have been missed out.

Back to the issue of *spatial distribution* and *diversity*, the former
seems to differ across scales (the scales of grain and extent are
identical for all urban form character in *spatial distribution* and,
with the exception of 2, in *diversity* as well). 17 out of 27 urban
form characters in *spatial distribution* category are present at S
scale. While the number is still lower than for the other groups (except
*diversity*), the gap seems to be more significant at larger scales. The
situation with *diversity* appears similar, featuring a majority of
urban form characters at M scale (15 in terms of grain and 17 in terms
of extent), but the overall number is too low to conclude scalar
dependency, even though such a tendency might be present.

An issue revealed by the proposed classification of urban form
characters is the *overlap* and at times *redundancy* of some of them
(the empirical correlation between urban form characters which makes
some redundant). This is most evident among those capturing *shape* at
the level of the block and below. Here a high number of such characters
is utilized in literature to capture the objects' geometry and form.
@basaraner2017 assessed the capacity of some of the
urban form characters to capture the complexity in shape of building
footprints and concluded that only six out of 20 generally used are
appropriate (p. 1972). Similar assessment should be done for other
types, to rule out redundancy and increase the effectiveness and
reliability of the fewer selected. On the other hand, the fact that
certain types of urban form characters are abundant and might overlap or
even lead to redundancy suggests that there is a general agreement on
their value as descriptors of urban form.

### Terminological inconsistency
Finally, terminological inconsistency could be explained by two causes.
On one hand, the current lack of a comprehensive framework for the
systematisation and comparability of urban form characters~~,~~ on the
other, the relative novelty of quantitative methods in urban morphology.
There is therefore urgent need for coherent terminology, as the amount
of quantitative studies is expected to rise with the development of
Geographic Information Systems (GIS), big data science, data mining as
well as open data and volunteer-based mapping services. The problems of
comparability of studies defined by @whitehand2012 could be limited if
a more rigorous typological system such as the *Index of Elements*
proposed in this paper was applied which would leave room for the
interpretation of urban form characters, while making them comparable.
In this regard, this work is dependent on the scope of existing research
and its validity is affected by the limits of the initial literature
review. However, we would argue that the method used to select papers
ensures a reasonable level of representativeness as demonstrated by the
fact that we were able to extract and successfully systematise 465 urban
form characters covering a significant number of measurements. The
consequent systematisation, exemplified in tab. 2 and reported in full
in the Table of Urban Form Characters (see online supplementary
materials) seems to be inclusive and coherent enough to make sense of
all of them, and yet this should be seen as just an initial framework.
The proposed systematisation is meant to be refined and expanded as
research progresses, in an open repository of tested urban form
characters which would be ideally a collective product of the urban
morphology scientific community as a whole ==momepy==.
Moreover, the work could be expanded by the inclusion of other ways of conceptualisation of urban form, to cover land use or behavioural
patterns (among others).

In reviewing the literature, we necessarily had to rely on previously
defined descriptions of both urban form characters and measurements. In several cases, these proved to be vague, sometimes lacking any
definitions and/or mathematical formulas. Therefore, our classification
of such characters might not align perfectly with the original source
work. Even if we were able to successfully classify all relevant urban
form characters, it still might be possible to find in the future some
that just do not fit into any of the six proposed categories (yet, it
would still be possible to define it through the *Index or Elements*
naming approach).

## Conclusions
Quantitative approaches to urban morphology are critical to inform the long overdue undertakings of a new “sciences of cities”. The current state of the discipline is, however, to some degree inconsistent. To progress further it is essential to understand what the limits and potentials of existing measuring methods are, and where the gaps of knowledge are.

The terminology used is often unclear, methods and urban form characters vary in ways that is at times difficult to understand. This limits the development of comparative studies, which however are essential to evidence-based research.

In this paper we presented a first attempt at systematically and
comprehensively organising existing measurable urban form characters
while overcoming terminological discrepancies. We collected a
significant and representative sample of published literature and
identified the main purposes of the research that underpinned it. From
this sample, we extracted individual urban form characters capturing the
physical structure of urban form and identified significant
terminological inconsistencies ("nicknaming"), which were seen as
undermining the comparability of research outcomes across cases and
methods. We then introduced a new terminological framework based on an
*Index of Element* approach, which then we tested to redefine all the
465 urban form characters extracted from literature. As a part of a
newly proposed conceptual typology, we organised them into six distinct
and inclusive categories. The new framework allowed us to identify a
degree of redundancy in both the definition of urban form characters and
their measurements, which led us to produce a more rigorous set of final
361.

When analysing how these urban form characters have been deployed, we
identified a few anomalies in the distribution of their qualifying
categories: the most significant tendency is the underrepresentation of
*spatial distribution* and *diversity*. Moreover, *shape* and
*dimension* are predominantly used at smaller scales, *connectivity* at
larger scales (this tendency does not seem to be consequence of the
nature of the urban form character, but rather the lesser production of
research on this topic).

Future research on the quantitative analysis of urban form, or urban morphometrics, should aim at collectively building a reasonably reliable and stable typology of measurable urban form characters, in order to achieve consistency across methods and case studies. Furthermore, the area should progress in recognising and measuring the full scalar and structural complexity of urban form, and we should be more comprehensive with regards to scales.

Finally, urban morphometrics is meant in principle to enhance the study of correlations between the physical and non-physical aspects of the global urban phenomenon, towards a unitary model covering both and yet accounting for their inherent differences.
