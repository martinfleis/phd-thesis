**â€ŒThe Urban Atlas: Methodological Foundation of a Morphometric Taxonomy of Urban Form**

Cities around the world are composed of a plethora of urban patterns, reflecting the differences in needs human populations have had over time. Their study is the domain of urban morphology, a field of research stretching from geography to architecture, which ability to identify such patterns in urban fabric is, however, still limited, notably using quantitative approaches. Data-driven methods characterising urban form, which are rich in terms of information, scalable (applicable to the large scale of extent, regional and national), and replicable are scarce, restricting the potential of comparative analysis and classification. 

This thesis, therefore, aims to link urban morphology and methodologically strong area of quantitative biological systematics, adapting its concepts and methods to the context of built-up fabric. That creates an infrastructure for numerical description of urban form, known as urban morphometrics, and a subsequent classification of urban types. 

Conceptually building on the theory of numerical taxonomy, this research progresses the development of urban morphometrics employing only minimal input data - street network and building footprints. Additionally, as a response to inherent data limitations, it incorporates generated morphological tessellation as the smallest spatial unit. Contiguity of tessellation then constitutes a basis of a relational framework aimed at the comprehensive characterisation of individual elements of urban form and their relationships. A resulting abundant numerical description of all features is further utilised in cluster analysis delineating urban tissue types in an unrestricted urban fabric, shaping an input for hierarchical classification of urban form - a taxonomy.

The proposed method is applied to the historical heterogeneous city of Prague, Czechia and validated using supplementary non-morphological data reflecting the variation of built-up patterns. Furthermore, its cross-cultural and morphological validity and expandability are tested by assessment of Amsterdam, Netherlands and a combination of both cases into a unified taxonomy of their urban patterns. The research is accompanied by a bespoke open-source software *momepy* for quantitative assessment of urban form, providing infrastructure for replicability and further community-led development.

The work builds a basis for morphometric research of urban environment, providing operational tools and frameworks for its application and further development, eventually leading to a coherent taxonomy of urban form.
