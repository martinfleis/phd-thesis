# Synthesis

"The last chapter which is currently only crudely outlined as the major part of the discussion will be based on the data I do not have at this moment (final clustering, taxonomy, extetended case study)."

## Research outcomes

### Reflections

#### Placement of the research in the context of chapter 2

#### Placement of the research in the context of chapter 3
+

## Applicability

### Applicability of Urban Morphometrics

#### Resilience of urban form

#### Climate-induced risk assessment

#### Prediction of FF types (Logistic Regression)

+

### Applicability of DHC and taxonomy

## Interpretation of the tree
*Taxonomic tree needs specific attention regarding its interpretation as the detail we can read can vary based on the stability of urban form under scrutiny.*

- Different branches allow different distiction

## Limitations

## Further research

fuzzinness
efficeincy - PCA, FA effects
