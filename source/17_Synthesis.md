# Synthesis TBD

"The last chapter which is currently only crudely outlined as the major part of the discussion will be based on the data I do not have at this moment (final clustering, taxonomy, extetended case study)."

## Interpretation of the tree
*Taxonomic tree needs specific attention regarding its interpretation as the detail we can read can vary based on the stability of urban form under scrutiny.*

- Different branches allow different distiction

## Limitations
It is not complicated to find case studies offering the data in required quality and detail, but it is true that data of this level of precision are not available everywhere around the world. That is true, especially for building height parameters. Having all data, as outlined above, is the ideal situation, which will be tested in this research. In the real world, the situation might be less optimal than that, so pre-processing procedures have to be employed before performing the analysis itself. The case analysis using extremely sub-optimal data is available as Annexe X, outlining the work done on Grand Rapids, Michigan using building footprints not representing individual buildings and missing any height attributes.


### Limits of morphological tessellation
Whilst MT and MC appear to be promising new addition to the tools available for UMM applications, a first limit of this work is that the cadastral parcels in Zurich, which we have loosely treated as ‘plots’, are solely based on land-ownership. That causes discrepancy between the generated tessellation and the cadastral layer which includes multi-building plots. However, as only 21% of plots are affected and results are reported for both groups, we believe that the presented method is robust enough to provide relevant results.

Second, whilst it is true that a MT can be generated directly from a building layer alone, it cannot be created from any building layer, as this needs to comply to certain quality requirements. Notably, since the method sees every feature of GIS layer as an individual input for tessellation, it is important not to have buildings composed of multiple features each representing, for example, different heights or different parts of the same (as in the case of British Ordnance Survey). Similarly, it is important not to have different independent buildings collapsed into a single simplified feature (as in the case of vast portions of Open Street Maps).

Further research should focus on the question of the exact meaning and variation of topological distance and its definition for specific purposes. The question of how many topological steps should be used for the analysis of urban form remains open. It is expected that it will vary depending on the scope of the research.

## Conclusions


*The conclusions in your last chapter must respond to the aim from Chapter 1 and chapter 5*
