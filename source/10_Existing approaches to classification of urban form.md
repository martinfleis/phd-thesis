# Existing approaches to classification of urban form
6 000 words (if less, better)

## Introduction
- Explain prior focus on quantitative morphology (link to introduction), but say that the chapters gives overview of all, with the focus on quantitative.

## Making sense of the world
- *Why is classification important, what can it bring to the table, why should we bother doing it.*
- What is classification
	- a bit of definitions
	- different ways of making classification
		- typology/taxonomy distinction **important**
- Why is classification useful in general
- Why is classification useful in urban morphology

## A brief history
- *Literature review of existing methods of classification and its analysis and description of patterns within the field.*
- Introduction

- *A brief overview of the history of classification of urban form focusing on its origins and early attempts. People like Lynch, Kostof.*

### Qualitative approach
- **Research TO DO**
- link between history and qualitative

- Traditional schools of urban morphology
	- Conzen
	- Muratori
	- Duany
- City-based approaches (Portland, Berlin, Prague)
- Spatial typology
	- Kohout, a+t
- The qualities of such approaches, their limits.
  - **Research TO DO (a bit)**
  - expert knowledge needed
  - concepts based
  - might be biased (not necessarily)
  - good in interpretation, could be detailed
  - time consuming, information demanding
  - limited applicability

### Mixed (predominantly non-morphological)
- Socio-demography as a main branch
- Additional (energy)
- The qualities of such approaches, their limits
	- capturing non-morphological classes
	- good for specific purposes
	- good source for link between form and soft data
- **Research TO DO (a bit)**

### Remote sensing
- Introduce RS
	- satellite or aerial data, automatic (multi-spectral) image recognition, supervised ML
- Units of analysis
	- patch
	- block
	- grid
	- *add some figures as an illustration*
- Number of categories
	- 1 - 10
- The qualities of such approaches, their limits
	- possible extent
	- only "visible" spectrum - roofs can make a lot of difference in RS but minimal in reality
	- mostly supervised nature - you have to predefine ground truth
	- the aspect of resolution and data availability
	- number of categories is generally low related to low number of actual indicators (like Copernicus)

## Quantitative classification
- introduction
	- what does it mean quantitative method
	- two major groups divided by the data source
		- remote sensing — raster data
		- morphometrics — vector data
			- *morphometrics can in theory be done on remote sensing as well, so it might be better to use another term*

- *This is the key focus of the whole chapter, and the majority of scrutinised works fall into this category. The rest mentioned above and below is to draw a full picture, but it does not aim to provide an in-depth understanding, unlike this part.*
- **Research TO DO - check recent papers, some might be included**
- Introduce quantitative morphology
- units of classification
  - *Assessment based on the unit of classification and its placement on the scale.*
  - gradient of scales
  - from city scale to building and plot
  - *do some quantitative assessment of the db*
- number of classes
  - generally low, in few cases higher
  - *do some quantitative assessment of the db*
- mention number of characters used for classification (scrutinised in the next chapter)
- Synthesis of the corpus of works
	- *taxonomic relations between types?*
	- The qualities of such approaches, their limits

## The gap in the systematic classification
- lack of systematic classification based on the small-scale unit
- gap in unsupervised classification
- gap in detailed classification (i.e. number of classes)
- gap in exploration of relationships between classes (*check before writing*)

## Conclusion
- *conclusion: the existing approaches and methods have gaps: the lack of systematic classification based on the small-scale units ~~using an extensive, inclusive set of indicators~~ enabling detailed classification into larger number of types/taxa/classes.  That should help position my work within the field and say what I am bringing new in later stages. BE CAREFUL TO CONCLUDE ONLY BASED ON THE CONTENT OF THE CHAPTER NOT MORE. FIND A GAP WHICH MAKES SENSE. THIS TEXT IS MIXING TOGETHER RESULTS OF THIS AND THE NEXT CHAPTER. THIS LOOKS AT THE UNIT AND NUMBER OF CLASSES MOSTLY. NUMBER OF CHARACTERS SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE NEXT CHAPTER.*
