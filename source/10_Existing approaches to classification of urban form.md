# Existing approaches to classification of urban form

_link back_

_aim of the chapter_
Explain prior focus on quantitative morphology (link to introduction), but say that the chapters gives overview of all, with the focus on quantitative.

_structure of the chapter_

## Making sense of the world
- *Why is classification important, what can it bring to the table, why should we bother doing it.*

### Classification as a method
*Classification is a polysemic term, so we first need to declutter it and define the terms as they will be used within this work.*

*The most simple definition of classification is "ordering of entities into groups or classes on the basis of their similarity" {REF Bailey p.1}. At the same time, classification is term used for both process and end result. ==add OED and some other defs, then say which def is used here==*

*there are different ways of doing classification, depending on the structure of the result and on the method. We can also distinguish between unidimensional and multidimensional.*

*structurally there are two main groups -  flat and hierarchical. In some rare cases, we can have overlapping*
	
*methodologically, we can distinguish two key ways - conceptual classification and numerical classification.*

*Typology. Conceptual classification is called typology. It is multidimensional. Classes represent "concepts rather than empirical cases" REF p.5. It is qualitative classification*

*Taxonomy. Classification of empirical entities. Term can be again both process end result.*

*â€ŒNumerical taxonomy vs. Cluster analysis vs. Unsupervised classification. In this work, taxonomy is used to describe the end result, while cluster analysis and unsupervised classification are interchangeable and describe the process, to clarify the situation a bit.*

*Since we are talking about unsupervised classification, it is worth noting that supervised classification is a bit different concept and it is rather labelling or classing. It is a tool to sort features into pre-defined categories, unlike all above, which encompass the determination of categories as well. Again, this is terminologic issue, but because it is not used in this work, we can leave it out. From the perspective of this work, it is not very useful.*

*Bailey identifies ten fundamental advantages of classification*
	- description
	- reduction of complexity
	- identification of similarities
	- identification of differences
	- capturing dimensions
	- comparison of types
	- the inventory and management of types
	- types as criteria for measurement
	- study of relationships
	- versatility

*All above are applicable in urban morphology as well, however, we have to deal with some complications.*
- Classification in urban morphology
	- question of time dimension (evolution, change)
	- question of concepts
	- question of empirical characters

### Optimal classification model
*what are we looking for - criteria of optimal classification ==link to intro==*
*So there is a plethora of options. From the perspective of the aim and scope of this work, the optimal classification model should follow few simple rules.*
- exhaustive, mutually exclusive, those are general rules
- empirical, hierarchical, comprehensive, detailed, scalable

## Significant concepts
- *few concepts are quite established*
- ==link those to the definitions above==

### Land Cover
*lc*
*issues*

### Local Climate Zones
*lcz*
*issues*

### Urban Structural Types
*ust*
*various methods if their identification, from qualitative heuristics based on visual assessment () to ML models*
*issues*

*conclude (also in relation to un/supervised)*

## Spectrum of classification models
==mention issues along the way==
==link those to the definitions above==
*apart from these, there is a wide spectrum of models*

### From city to plot level
*go from city scale to building scale*

### Multiple Fabric Assessment and Chalmers School
*araldi*
*chalmers*

## The gap in the systematic classification
- lack of systematic classification based on the small-scale unit
- gap in unsupervised classification
- gap in detailed classification (i.e. number of classes)
- gap in exploration of relationships between classes (*check before writing*)

## Conclusion
- *conclusion: the existing approaches and methods have gaps: the lack of systematic classification based on the small-scale units ~~using an extensive, inclusive set of indicators~~ enabling detailed classification into larger number of types/taxa/classes.  That should help position my work within the field and say what I am bringing new in later stages. BE CAREFUL TO CONCLUDE ONLY BASED ON THE CONTENT OF THE CHAPTER NOT MORE. FIND A GAP WHICH MAKES SENSE. THIS TEXT IS MIXING TOGETHER RESULTS OF THIS AND THE NEXT CHAPTER. THIS LOOKS AT THE UNIT AND NUMBER OF CLASSES MOSTLY. NUMBER OF CHARACTERS SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE NEXT CHAPTER.*
