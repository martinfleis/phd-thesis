# Existing approaches to classification of urban form

_link back_
*The aim and key interest of this research as outlined in the introduction is classification of urban form.*

_aim of the chapter_
*Aim of this chapter is to understand various models of classification from theoretical perspective and review how they have been applied to urban form to date.* 
*focus on quantitative morphology (link to introduction), but some detours are necessary to give a full picture*

_structure of the chapter_
*- theory of classification*
*- optimal classification model*
*- spectrum of classification models used in literature*
	*- recurring concepts*
	*- from city to plot scale variety*
	*- close work*
*- the gap*

## Making sense of the world
- *Why is classification important, what can it bring to the table, why should we bother doing it.*

### Classification as a method
*Classification is a polysemic term, so we first need to declutter it and define the terms as they will be used within this work.*

*The most simple definition of classification is "ordering of entities into groups or classes on the basis of their similarity" {REF Bailey p.1}. At the same time, classification is term used for both process and end result. ==add OED and some other defs, then say which def is used here==*

*there are different ways of doing classification, depending on the structure of the result and on the method. We can also distinguish between unidimensional and multidimensional.*

*structurally there are two main groups -  flat and hierarchical. In some rare cases, we can have overlapping*
	
*methodologically, we can distinguish two key ways - conceptual classification and numerical classification.*

*Typology. Conceptual classification is called typology. It is multidimensional. Classes represent "concepts rather than empirical cases" REF p.5. It is qualitative classification*

*Taxonomy. Classification of empirical entities. Term can be again both process end result.*

*â€ŒNumerical taxonomy vs. Cluster analysis vs. Unsupervised classification. In this work, taxonomy is used to describe the end result, while cluster analysis and unsupervised classification are interchangeable and describe the process, to clarify the situation a bit.*

*Since we are talking about unsupervised classification, it is worth noting that supervised classification is a bit different concept and it is rather labelling or classing. It is a tool to sort features into pre-defined categories, unlike all above, which encompass the determination of categories as well. Again, this is terminologic issue, but because it is not used in this work, we can leave it out. From the perspective of this work, it is not very useful.*

*Bailey identifies ten fundamental advantages of classification*
	- description
	- reduction of complexity
	- identification of similarities
	- identification of differences
	- capturing dimensions
	- comparison of types
	- the inventory and management of types
	- types as criteria for measurement
	- study of relationships
	- versatility

*All above are applicable in urban morphology as well, however, we have to deal with some complications.*
- Classification in urban morphology
	- question of time dimension (evolution, change)
	- question of concepts
	- question of empirical characters

### Optimal classification model
*what are we looking for - criteria of optimal classification ==link to intro==*
*So there is a plethora of options. From the perspective of the aim and scope of this work, the optimal classification model (OCM) should follow few simple rules.*
- exhaustive, mutually exclusive, those are general rules
- empirical, hierarchical, comprehensive, detailed, scalable

## Spectrum of classification models
- *There are two main branches of science focusing on urban form classification, which are surprisingly separated from each other - remote sensing and urban morphology. The diffusion between approaches is minimal, even thought conceptually focus on the same questions. ==explain scope ignoring purely qualitative methods==*

### Recurring concepts
- *Few concepts are quite established and worth exploring their characteristics.*

- ==link those to the definitions above==

#### Urban Structural Types
*The concept of Urban Structural Types firstly used in 1960s REF, then reintroduced in 1992 REF is covering various methods. Despite its popularity in remote sensing, it is quite inconsistent. ==define==*
*various methods if their identification, from qualitative heuristics based on visual assessment () to ML models ==give examples==*
- popular in remote sensing, but inconsistent
- "diverse understanding of subject and implementations" Lehner p.2
- "defined by specific spatial characteristics, e.g., the morphology and the spatial relationships between urban artefacts such as buildings, streets, trees, lawns"  Lehner p.2
- Mostly typology, few examples of taxonomy
- "there are only a few that use the same USTs for more than one city in terms of definition, description and derivation" Lehner p.7
- often flat
- different scales
- Lehner proposes generic UST framework, which is hierarchical typology. But since it is generic and typological it does not fulfil conditions above either.

*In relation to the OCM requirements it is complicated to assess the concept as a whole due to its internal inconsistency, but USTs are mostly typologies.*

#### Land Cover
*Related concept focuses on land cover only, again based on remote sensing. It usually aims to classify all areas, not only urban.*
- urban form as a part of wider classification of land
- Corine = continuous x discontinuous, industrial/commercial, ports, airports
	- level 1, level 2, level 3 - hierarchical
- Copernicus urban atlas
	- added density on top of continuity
- Pauleit Duhme - 10 UF types
*issues*
- *comes as Typology first, then data are being labelled*

#### Local Climate Zones
*Local climate zones mix both structure and land cover into typology*
- typology of 10 built types and 7 land cover types
- quite generic, so it covers everything
- still top-level
- used in RS field on a large scale
- flat classification
- numerically defined classes, but still capturing conceptual division
*lcz*
*issues*
*The example of typology, and inherits its limitations.*

==mention issues along the way==
==link those to the definitions above==
*apart from these, there is a wide spectrum of models*

### From city to plot level
*Apart from recurring concepts, wide range of classification methods was proposed in urban morphology, ranging from typologies to taxonomies and from city to building scales.*

*go from city scale to building scale ==always say the relation typology/taxonomy and OCM requirements==*
*most of these methods are typologies*


### Multiple Fabric Assessment and Chalmers School
*there are two recent notable works which are closest to the OCM requirements, and that is Multiple Fabric Assessment proposed by Araldi and Fusco and typology of plot systems, street network systems and --- by Berghauser Pont ...*

*Araldi focus on street segment... describe, issues (limited number of characters, assumption of homogeneity, no hierarchy, applied to local cases with no cross-comparison framework*

*Chalmers developed typology based on empirical cases. Three different typologies, not really combined. Limited amount of characters. Data requirements.*

## The gap in the systematic classification
*As shown, none of existing models is all empirical, hierarchical, comprehensive, detailed and scalable. Some are close, but none fits all criteria.*
- lack of systematic classification based on the small-scale unit
- gap in taxonomy (empirical cluster analysis)
- gap in detailed classification (i.e. number of classes)


## Conclusion
*Classification is polysemic term. This work focuses on a specific way of doing it, taxonomy, with specific requirements defining the optimal model.*

*Existing models vary, from remote sensing models to typo-morphological, but none fulfils the all criteria. Some are close, but the gap is clear and wide.*
