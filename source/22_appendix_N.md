# Appendix N: Reproducible computational Jupyter notebooks {.unnumbered}

Appending N contains a selection of key Jupyter notebooks used in the thesis. Notebooks contain reproducible Python code largely dependent on momepy, which code is not inlcuded as can be seen on github.com/martinfleis/momepy. The goal of this appendix is to allow easy reproducibility of each critical step of the research. Notebooks mostly consist of code actual production code, which means that it may not always follow the optimal patterns. However, the key contribution of this research on the ground of reproducibility are not notebooks, but momepy as an independent, fully documented and teseted open-source package.

Following pages are automaticly generated from original Jupyter notebooks, therefore their formatting might not be always optimal.
