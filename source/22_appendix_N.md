# Appendix N: Reproducible computational Jupyter notebooks {.unnumbered}

Appendix N comprises a selection of key Jupyter notebooks used in the thesis. Notebooks contain reproducible Python code largely dependent on momepy, which code is not included in notebooks and is documented in Annexe 1. The goal of this appendix is to allow easy reproducibility of each critical step of the research. Notebooks mostly consist of code actual production code, which means that it may not always follow the optimal patterns. However, the major contribution of this research on the ground of reproducibility are not notebooks, but momepy as an independent fully documented and tested open-source package.

The PDF version of Jupyter notebooks spans across more than 100 pages, therefore is not directly included in the main submission. The complete set is available at:
