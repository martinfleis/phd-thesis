# Introduction

## Context of the study
==title?==
- *key issues, understand the many strands of concern, and be focused on one particular challenge*
- *aware of the conventions in their community*
- *Provide a brief history of the issues to date.*
- *Situate your particular topic within the broad area of research.*
- *Note that the field is changing, and more research is required on your topic.*

==story:==
==1) people are interested in urban patterns,== 
==2) we are entering the era of data,==
==3) data-driven pattern analysis==


- A) interest in cities and its **urban patterns**

- different perspectives on patterns
	1. Relations (UF -> other aspects)
		- alongside with the rising trend in such a research ==LINK to %==
			- different purposes
			- energy, walkability, quality of life, health, economy, cost
			- sustainable development
				- data-driven decision making
	2. Classification
		- classification/typology history
			- patterns are of interest for long time
				- Lynch
				- planning-focus
				- descriptive-focus
					- qualitative
					- data-driven
				- reflection of the socio-economico-cultural conditions
		- ==this is the only section which talks about the qualitative stuff==
			


- B) data era
	- data-driven science
	- big data
	- algorithms
	- AI, ML
	- current trends
		- interest in GIS, RS, data

- A+B) topic - data-driven description and classification of urban pattern
	- large scale
	- algorithmic
	- objective
	- comphrehensive
	- scalable
	- detailed



## statement of the problem / motivation for the study
==title?==
- *motivate further interest in the area*
- *your research is nearly always an attempt to find a solution to a problem that you have identified*
- *the driving force behind your research*
- *make it relevant, definitive, and free of ambiguities*
- *no review of literature or theory here (he did review it later in his thesis), merely a clear statement that here was a large problem that was worth putting some effort into*
- *It acts as the precursor to the research aim*
-  *In summary, a ‘Statement of the Problem’ or ‘Motivation for the Study’ generally contains four parts:*
	-  *A brief history of the issue at hand (‘Since the early 1950s, there has been ...’).*
	-  *A recent increase of the issue (‘Recently, however, an increase in the ...’).*
	-  *Dissatisfaction with current knowledge (‘To date, however, the lack of ...’).*
	-  *An identification of specific set of factors (‘In particular, a focus on ...’).*
-  *Identify a key point of concern*
-  *Refer to the literature only to the extent needed to demonstrate why your project is worth doing. Reserve your full review of existing theory or practice for later chapters.*
-  *Be sure that the motivation, or problem, suggests a need for further investigation.*

- algorithmic understanding of form is relatively new
	- Batty
	- Space Syntax
	- MCA
	- MFA
	- Remote sensing
	- all these are great and the filed is rapidly developing


- recently, tools and data are more available as is the focus on cities

- the algorithmic understanding of form is still in its infancy
	- vague description
		- vague classification
		- arbitrary selection of descriptors for relationship analyses, 
	- while there is space syntax and other (MCA, MFA, Chalmers), it is still a start
	- none tackles the complexity of form
	- it does not offer classification of patterns. The most they do is the detection of different ones ==check with ch2==
	- no relations between types
	- or just a bits and pieces here and there
		- either classification into types
		- or relations between types
		- or otherwise limited (Dibble)
	- mostly, **relations** are missing and not thoroughly identified and studied
	
- in particular focus on identification or urban patterns and their classification (taxonomy)
	- data-driven
	- ML
	- comprehensive

## aim and scope
==title?==
- *aim*
	- *follow as a logical consequence of the problem statement*
	- *You must identify only one aim*
	- *The conclusions in your last chapter must respond to this aim*
	- *make sure research questions are clear in the statement of your aim*
- *scope*
	- *set out limits*
	- *a focused, high-impact study*
	- *identifying limitations of factors such as time, location, resources, or the established boundaries of particular fields or theories.*

*aim*
- a **method** of derivation of data-driven taxonomy of urban form patterns
	- taxonomy is a specific kind of classification which (relations)
	- *==I am providing a method of doing taxonomy, not the taxonomy itself==*

*scope*
- minimal data input
- purely quantitative
- purely form-focused 
	- excluding land use, POIs and any other data
- comprehensive, inclusive
- reproducible & replicable
- urban morphometrics
- vector data

## significance of the study
==title?==

- *scope is linked to the significance*
- *equate it with potential impact*
- *theoretical level*
- *practical level*
- *Explain how your thesis contributes to the field.*
- *There are four main areas of contribution: theory development, tangible solution, **innovative methods**, and policy extension. One of these contributions must be identified as the basis of your primary contribution to the field.*

- wide applicability
- primary research backing up further studies related to urban form
	- ==LINK to %==
- replicable method

- on theoretical level
	- develop umm description of form, relational model, units (tissue as OTU)
- on practical level
	- develop a method of classification

## Overview of the Study
==title?==

- *follow on logically from your statement of the aim*
- *an annotated version of the table of contents*
- *a synopsis of the storyline*
- *Sketch out how the thesis is structured. Don’t confine yourself to a list of the chapters, but show how they are linked and that one section logically leads to another.*
- *Check whether the reader can see from this sketch how the aim will be achieved.*

- understand existing classification attempts
- understand quantitative description of form
- understand taxonomy
- specify hypothesis and method
- define structural elements and theory of description of form
- define a method of identification of patterns
- define taxonomy of patterns
- discuss, conclude
