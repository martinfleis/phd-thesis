\textbf{block} & The contiguous portion of land comprised of cells whose centroids are is normally bounded by streets or open space.\tabularnewline
\textbf{cell (as Voronoi cell)} & A developed piece of land associated with one building representing the area of its spatial influence.\tabularnewline
\textbf{character (as taxonomic character)} & A characteristics (or feature) of one kind of urban tissue that will distinguish it from another kind.\tabularnewline
\textbf{classification} & The ordering of urban tissues into groups (or sets) on the basis of their relationships.\tabularnewline
\textbf{cluster (as distinct homogenous cluster)} & A number of similar elements that occur together in consistent pattern. The smallest unit of taxonomic analysis, as the smallest distinct physiognomically homogenous cluster. \tabularnewline
\textbf{element} & Single geometrical entity representing feature of urban form.\tabularnewline
\textbf{evolution} & Long-term adaptation.\tabularnewline
\textbf{identification} & Allocation or assignment of additional unidentified objects to the correct class once a classification has been established.\tabularnewline
\textbf{kind (or species)} & Morphologically similar group of urban tissues linked by common phenetic characteristics and morphologically distinct from other groups assigned to different species.\tabularnewline
\textbf{operational taxonomic unit} & The lowest ranking taxa employed in a given study. In this case cluster.\tabularnewline
\textbf{phenetic \linebreak relationship} & Similarity (resemblance) based on a set of phenotypic characteristics of the objects or organisms under study.\tabularnewline
\textbf{phenetics} & Overall similarity.\tabularnewline
\textbf{phenotype} & The appearance of the urban tissue, when dealing with characters combinations.\tabularnewline
\textbf{plot} & A parcel of land representing a land-use unit defined by boundaries on the ground" (Conzen, 1969, p. 128)\tabularnewline
\textbf{street edge} & Sequence of cells primarily facing one street network segment.\tabularnewline
\textbf{systematics} & The study of the kinds and diversity of organisms (or urban tissues) and of any and all relationships among them.\tabularnewline
\textbf{taxon} & Taxonomic group or entity.\tabularnewline
\textbf{taxonomy} & The grouping by numerical methods of taxonomic units into taxa based on their character states\tabularnewline
\textbf{type} & A particular kind, class, or group defined as a conceptual entity\tabularnewline
\textbf{typology} & Classification based on types.\tabularnewline
\textbf{urban area} & The area covered by continuous urban development.\tabularnewline
\textbf{urban form} & The physical characteristics that make up built-up areas, including the shape, size, density and configuration of settlements.\tabularnewline
\textbf{urban tissue} & A distinct area of a settlement in all three dimensions, characterised by a unique combination of streets, blocks/plot series, plots, buildings, structures and materials and usually the result of a distinct process of formation at a particular time or period. \tabularnewline
