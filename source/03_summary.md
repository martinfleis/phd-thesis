Understanding different morphological patterns that characterise cities and their parts is an essential pursuit of urban morphology. However, the discipline is still looking for quantitative methods of pattern detection, which are rich in terms of information, scalable (applicable to the large scale of extent, regional and national), and replicable.

This thesis presents progress towards this goal, which respects the principles of urban morphometrics: the pursuit of a quantitative, systematic and comprehensive analysis of urban form. By linking numerical taxonomy (derived from evolutionary biology) and urban morphology, it provides a method of abundant numerical characterisation of each fundamental element of urban form derived from its immediate context. Furthermore, it proposes a cluster analysis employing the characterisation to identify distinct homogenous patterns of urban development. All that is leading to a foundation for the development of numerical taxonomy of urban form, proposing an expandable method of a hierarchical classification of automatically delineated patterns.

Thanks to minimal input-data requirements, i.e. street network and buildings (footprint and height), and quantitative algorithmic nature, this procedure allows large-scale analysis. This work proposes employment of morphological tessellation as a basic spatial unit taking the role of a plot as a response to inherent data limitations and as a central element of the proposed recognition model exploiting its topological contiguity.

The proposed method is applied to the historical heterogeneous city of Prague, Czechia and validated using supplementary non-morphological data reflecting the variation of built-up patterns. Furthermore, its cross-cultural and morphological validity and expandability are tested by assessment of Amsterdam, Netherlands and a combination of both cases into a unified taxonomy of their urban forms.

The presented research is accompanied by a bespoke open-source software *momepy* for quantitative assessment of urban form, providing infrastructure for replicability and further community-led development of research in urban morphometrics.
