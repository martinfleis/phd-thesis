# Propositions

## Synthesis of background chapters
*Draw on the conclusions of the background chapters to identify your research hypotheses or research questions.*

*Understand where your work lies on the dimensions that are appropriate to your discipline: theoretical or applied, study or case study, and so on. Use this understanding to inform your explanation of your intended contribution.*

*Positioning requires justification. For example, if you decide on a case-study approach, explain why, and justify your choice of specific case to study; if a long description of the case is needed, note that you will do this in a separate following chapter.*

==always link back to previous chapters==
==link to introduction (aim, context, problem)==

- ch2: classification is done in some ways, but something is always missing
- ch3: measuring is done is some ways, but none is comprehensive and detailed enough
- ch4: biology offers a method to do that properly

- ch1: *synthesise in relation to aim, context and problem from ch1* 

==write after background chapters are done==

## Hypothesis & questions
- *link to the statement of the problem*
- *link to the aim and scope*
- *link to the significance*

### Hypothesis
> Methods of morphometrics and numerical taxonomy established in the classification of biological species can be applied in the context of urban morphology to lay foundations of numerical taxonomy of urban form.

*that would… link to gaps from background and introduction*
 
### Research questions
#### Main research question

> How to adapt methods of numerical taxonomy to urban form?
 
#### Supplementary research questions

- What are the fundamental morphometric elements and how to model their relationship? ==ch6==
- What is the optimal Operational Taxonomic Unit of urban form and how to identify it in continuous urban fabric? ==ch6+7==
	- ==the first part is rather theoretical and comes with the hypothesis [link to ch4 (Dibble critique)] that optimal OTU would be urban tissue==
- What are the taxonomic characters describing urban form? ==ch7==
- How to determine the taxonomic relationship between OTUs to derive taxa of urban form? ==ch8==

*a discussion of the properties that the innovation is expected to have (that is, what is it predicted to do?) and of criteria that it is intended to meet*

## Methodological propositions
- *describe method and say why this particular method*
- *Discuss the range of research methods that could be used to test your hypotheses or answer your questions, and choose the most appropriate. Don’t forget to justify your choice, even if it is standard for your discipline.*
- *Experimental validation requires an experimental design. Expect to have to explain it in detail, and also to justify it. Make appropriate choices of measurement or assessment mechanisms.*
- *link to the scope*

*If you have not already described your detailed research procedure in the ‘Research Design’ chapter you should describe it first before you go on to report any research results.*

*building a case that your new approach solves problems that previous approaches neglected.*

*top level to reflect the questions above and chapter-level*

### Assessment of morphometric elements

*fundamental elements, aggregations, models*
- understand fundamental elements for morphometric assessment ==link to scope==
	- exploration of morphological tessellation
- understand methods of their aggregation to larger spatial units
- understand models of capturing relations between elements and their aggregations
*leading to the relational model and tissue as OTU*
- define the model of capturing the relationship between elements and their aggregations 
- define the role of urban tissue in relation to the model

### Identification of OTU in urban fabric

*selection and definition of morphometric characters*
- definition of selection criteria
- primary and contextual characters
- selection of primary characters
- selection of contextual characters
*identification of OTU using unsupervised ML*
- clustering method (==justify selection==)
	- ==move from ch7?==

### Estimating taxonomic relationships

*Ward's hierarchical clustering*
- clustering method

### Validation
*Validation theory*
- if it relates to data and works elsewhere and can be expanded
*validation method*
- relation to data
- transferability
- expandability
- *if A & B & C, then valid*

### momepy: Urban Morphology Measuring Toolkit
reproducibility, scalability, openness
Need for tools
==link functions and classes to each relevant stage==
==link Jupyter notebooks to each relevant stage==

### Case studies
*for a case study, you need to persuade the reader that the subject is representative of a broader population.*

Amsterdam
- brief description

Zurich
- used for a specific task (mostly due to publishing as an independent paper)
- brief description (take from ch6)

## Outline of the second part

*These components together form a hypothesis*

*Design a narrative flow that takes the reader painlessly through the central part of your thesis—the part that consists of the new ideas that you are arguing for (and is thus the most unfamiliar).*

*Ensure that at all stages you have a clear understanding of the argument you*
*intend to use for linking of question, data, analysis, and outcome.*
