# Taxonomy of urban tissues

The previous chapters introduced the framework implementing urban morphometrics on a metropolitan scale. Based on the selection of morphometric characters, it established a method of a complex description of urban form on the scale of individual buildings. As reported, derived information then enabled the identification of urban tissues within urban form using the proxy of a distinct homogenous cluster. Consequent results of the unsupervised clustering indicate the validity of DHCs in recognition of urban form patterns and the potential for both additional subdivision and upscaling of the model.

In this chapter, therefore, the observed clusters are employed in the role of input data and investigated from three perspectives - 1) conceptualisation of clusters as *individuals*, leading to the taxonomic classification, 2) validity of clusters as a proxy of urban tissues and 3) the transferability of the method to the different geographical context. 

This chapter relates back to chapter 4 and introduces numerical taxonomy of urban tissues. The resulting classification is subsequently validated together with initial clusters based on the study of its relationship to the supplementary, non-morphological data known to be descriptive of urban form. Finally, the case study of Amsterdam is included to examine the ability of the proposed morphometric framework to identify urban tissues in the context of another heterogenous historical city, although of very different patterns of development. 

Structurally, this chapter is divided into two major parts, complemented by an introduction and conclusions. The introduction outlines the need for a classification of urban tissues (section \ref{need_taxonomy}) and bridges the theory of numerical taxonomy from chapter 4 to the context of distinct homogeneous clusters (section \ref{taxonomy_as_method}). Furthermore, it explains the importance of validation and two validation models used within this study (section \ref{need_validation}).

The two major parts are Methodological proposition (section \ref{method_prop8}) and Case studies (section \ref{case8}). The structure of the methodological section is reflected in the structure of case studies, having each part of the proposed method tested in the relevant part of the associated case studies section.  

Methodological propositions firstly introduce the method of hierarchical clustering, leading to the taxonomy of urban tissues (section \ref{hierarch_method}). Moreover, the results are utilised in the next section \ref{meth_validation} establishing the method of validation of identified urban tissues and their taxonomy, using data on historical origin, land-use patterns and qualitative classification of urban areas. Finally, the second part of the section \ref{hierarch_method} brings in the another case study (Amsterdam) and presents the method of evaluation of transferability of the morphometric assessment of urban tissues. The evaluation focuses on the identification of distinct homogenous clusters, their hierarchical classification and combination of two geographically distinct datasets to a single taxonomy, examining the extensibility of the method. Following section \ref{case8} presents the results of proposed method applied to case studies in the same order and hierarchy of sections.

The final section (\ref{conclusion8}) of the chapter concludes the findings and prepares the foundation for chapter 9, synthesising and discussing the whole research.

## Classsification and validation \label{need_taxonomy}

The distinct homogenous clusters presented in the previous chapter are, as units of urban form, all seen as equal, meaning that there is no specified relationship between them. However, the degree of similarity between individual clusters varies and has to be quantified. Therefore, a numerical representation of similarity, based on already measured morphometric characters, becomes a basis for the further classification of urban tissues. 

As illustrated in ==chapter 2==, there have been attempts to deliver classification frameworks, but apart from [@dibble2017], none have quantified the relation between different groups. This section proposes application of biological model of classification in a shape of a numerical taxonomy leading to the establishing hierarchical classification as a conceptual basis for the *atlas of urban form.*

However, the model of identification of urban tissues and their classification needs to be validated. There are two critical questions regarding the validity which needs to be answered:

1. Are distinct homogenous clusters a valid proxy of urban tissues?
2. Is the method transferable outside of the context of initial case study?

To answer the first question, this section introduces a validation as an  assessment of relation of the DHCs and their classification to additional data, which are known to be linked to the form of cities. The significant relationship between them and proposed clustering and classification would therefore indicate their validity and the validity of the proposed method. The second question requires inclusion of another case study from a different geographical and historical context. DHCs and their classification identified in that case study should be internally valid and comparable with those identified in Prague. 

### Taxonomy as a classification method \label{taxonomy_as_method}

Resulting clusters can be theoretically interpreted, in a conceptual sense, as individuals and studied as such. The core of the study of individuals of any species or entity is the classification, which in biology could take a shape of a taxonomic tree. Based on the propositions outlined in the chapter 4, biological analogy is taken further in this chapter, to propose a numerical taxonomy of urban form. The operational taxonomic unit (OTU) in this case is an urban tissue represented by the DHC. Each cluster as a while is considered as a single unit for the purpose of the classification. The principle of classification then follows the concepts of numerical taxonomy [@sneath1973] with only a minor adaptations related to the definition of taxonomic characters.

Urban form is traditionally (REF) classified not in a taxonomic, but in a typologic way. Where taxonomy is based on quantitative relations between its elements, typology follows conceptual division (REF). Both approaches are valid as they assess the same entity (urban form) from a different perspective. Moreover, if the classification results coincide, the method can validate each other. This study aims to explore the potential of quantitative description of urban form, hence it is natural that it chooses the path of taxonomy. However, typological classification of DHCs would be relevant either.

The taxonomy results in the hierarchical tree capturing the relationship of clusters, or *taxa*. That allows the agglomeration of the lowest-level taxa into higher level ones, adaptively changing the resolution of urban form classification. That is especially helpful for studies assessing the effect of urban form on socio-economic aspects as it can adapt to coarser data.

Moreover, the tree itself should be expandable, allowing for a development of the *Atlas* of urban form in a way we already know from biology. Such an atlas is a theoretical ==more stuff here==.

## Methodological proposition \label{method_prop8}
TEXT

### hierarchical clustering \label{hierarch_method}
==How does HC works.==

Hierarchical clustering in case of urban tissues aims to develop a hierarchy of similarities between observations based on their morphometric profiles. We can generally distinguish two main principles, agglomerative and divisive. The former starts with the pool of observations each with its own cluster and identifies pairs of clusters while moving up the hierarchy. The latter does the opposite as it starts with a single cluster and iteratively divides it while moving down the hierarchy. Statistics offer a wide range of procedures for both principles, which description is out of scope of this research. The key decisions to be made are in the definition of distance between clusters and linkage criteria. 

Each of the distinct homogenous clusters is represented by its centroid within the hyperspace.

### validation \label{meth_validation}
Validation of identification of DHC and consequent hierarchical clustering is done in two ways. The first one studies the relationship of resulting classification to additional non-morphometric data to verify whether the expected link between morphology and other aspects is present in the data. The second approach tests the applicability of the method outside of the initial case study. As the design and decision making behind it was based on the Prague dataset, it may have incurred context-specific features which limits the applicability of the method elsewhere. To ensure that this did not happen, the method should be applied to unrelated data and resulting classification should be examined to ensure that the results are comparable.

#### relation to additional data \label{meth_validation_rel}
Capturing the relation of proposed classification to additional data is an indirect validation method. There are theoretical grounds on which we can expect that the relation between urban form and other data exist and hence should be present in the classification as well. It is well known, that the urban patterns change based on the era in which they are built, meaning that there is a significant relation between urban types and their historical origin REF DIBBLE ALTERATIONS. Similar relation could be find with land use patterns and some other data. 

However, such additional should not be seen as a ground truth for classification as it does not reflect the same concepts. The relation should be seen as indicative. 

In this research, proposed classification will be compared with three datasets -  1) the period of historical origin of a place, 2) predominant land-use patterns, and 3) qualitative typology of urban form. All three will use the method of validation, based on a) statistical analysis using chi-square statistic and related Cramér's-V, b) compositional analysis focusing on the composition of each cluster in relation to the tested data, and c) visual assessment of spatial distribution to illustrate the behaviour of both compared data in space.

##### Analytical tools
The detailed method of application of selected analytical tools is proposed below.

###### Chi-square test of independence
The proposed classification is a categorical variable by nature and all three datasets as well, including the historical origin which is presented as unevenly distributed eras rather than age. The chi-square test of independence of variables determines whether there is a significant relationship between two categorical variables based on a contingency table REF. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) and alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) of the analysis states that 

> $H_0$: Morphometric classification of urban tissues is independent of $variable$.
> $H_1$: Morphometric classification of urban tissues is not independent of $variable$.

The statistic itself is denoted as

(@eq_chi) $\sum \chi_{i j}^{2}=\frac{(O-E)^{2}}{E}$,

where $O$ is the actual observed count, $E$ is the expected value, $chi^{2}$ is the cell Chi-square value. The expected value $E$ is calculated as

(@eq_chi_e) $E=\frac{M_{R} \times M_{C}}{n}$,

where $M_{R}$ is the row marginal (sum of the row) for the cell, $M_{C}$ is the column marginal (sum of the column) for the cell and $n$ is the total sample size. REF McHugh

The chosen alpha level of significance is $\alpha = 0.01$.

The actual implementation is based on `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency` function REF. 

###### Cramér's V
The chi-squared statistic does indicate whether there is an association or not, but does not tell how strong it is. Cramér's V coefficient is based on chi-squared statistic, but extends it to provide a value between 0 and 1 reflecting the level of association in a similar way as Pearson's correlation does. Value 0 corresponds to no association while 1 to perfect association REF http://www.acastat.com/statbook/chisqassoc.htm.
Cramér's V coefficient is denoted as 

(@eq_cramer) $V=\sqrt{\frac{\chi^{2}}{n(q-1)}}$

where $q$ is the smaller number of either rows or columns. The strength of association described by $V$ is illustrated in table \ref{cramer}.

| $V$ | association |
|--:|:--|
| >.5 | high |
| .3 to .5 | moderate |
| .1 to .3 | low |
| 0 to .1 | little if any |

Table: Strength of association of two categorical variables based on Cramér's V coefficient. Reproduced from REF. \label{cramer}

###### Compositional analysis
Each of the clusters and each of the branches is then studied independently to understand what is its composition in relation to the validation data. The composition is captured as a relative frequency of counts of features within each of the validation classes. In other words, it analyses individual rows of a contingency table. The perfect relation would show a frequency of 1 for a single class within a cluster and 0 for every other class. No relation would be reflected by equal frequencies among the classes. Compositional analysis is aimed to provide more in-depth interpretative values that chi-square and Cramer's-V, but it does not state a significance.

###### Spatial distribution 
The visual assessment of spatial distribution overlays the boundaries defined by morphometric classification over the validation classes to determine spatial relationship visually. Alongside the compositional analysis, the visual assessment is meant to provide interpretative information, allowing better understanding of the relation between tested data. It does not provide any numerical results as it only links compositional analysis with the geographical context.

##### Validation data
Three datasets are used within the validation framework - historical origin, land use patterns and qualitative typology of urban form linked to the predefined boundaries.

###### origin
The link between the historical origin and the patterns of urban form is well established in the literature REF Panerai and has been recently studied using morphometric tools, from the composition and configuration of street networks (REF Alt, Boeing) to the complex morphometric assessment of sanctuary areas (REF dibble). The relation, which is described in literature, should be present in the data studied in this research. The existence of the significant relationship between the historical origin and results of morphometric classification would indicate the validity of the classification itself.

The data on historical origin provided by Institute for planning and development Prague denotes the time frame in which was each part of the city first built-up. However, the data do not provide a single year, but a specific range, presenting what would be continuous variable of age as ordered categorical one. Moreover, the categories are not equal distributed in time, with maximum within each being 1840, 1880, 1920, 1950, 1970, 1990, and 2012. That may lead to the situation where three adjacent building, built in years 1878, 1879 and 1881 are not seen as of the (almost) same age. The first two are in the second category, being treated as equal while the last is in the third category being treated as different. Moreover, its difference from 1841 is the same as the difference from 1949. 

These data ignore the redevelopment of parts of the city which happened later. Newly built areas, which are built in the area of previously demolished urban form are not reflected and should be interpreted accordingly.

However, even with this limitations, dataset does represent the different periods of Prague's development and there should be a significant relation.

Before doing the analysis itself, data on historic origin were spatially linked to building layer. Each building got assigned a single category of origin denoting not its own period of origin, but the first moment of the development of the area it sits in.

###### Land use patterns
Land use is determining building typology which is partially reflected in the patterns of urban form. Single-family housing is always different from industrial or commercial areas, while multi-family housing can be developed in plethora of ways, but still different from other uses. That gives us theoretical grounds for validation of proposed morphometric taxonomy using land use patterns. However, it has to be noted that such a relation will likely not be perfect, as there are mixed uses in many places. 

The data on land use in Prague capture land use to the level of individual building and plot and divides it into 123 categories. However, of those only 15 contains more than 1,000 buildings. Categories are providing detailed classification, but that does not reflect predominant tendency of land use within the area but the individual buildings. For that reason, the initial data are used to compute predominant land-use patterns within three topological steps on morphological tessellation. As predominant land-use is seen the one with the highest frequency within the *context.*

Initial land-use data are spatially linked to buildings layers to have a single value representing category per building. Then the predominant land-use is calculated based on the context. Out of resulting categories, only 5 (*Multi-family housing, Single-family housing, Villas, Industry small, Industry large*) contains more than 1% of the dataset. For that reason, these five are used and the rest is denoted as *Other*.

###### qualitative typology
Planning system of Prague is based on the concept of *localities*, small neighbourhoods REF. Each neighbourhood has specified boundaries partially based on its morphology and partially on other aspects, from historical origin to social perception of the area. Furthermore, these neighbourhoods were qualitatively classified according to *structural types* into one of the 10 types. This typology tends to capture morphology and as such could be used as a validation method. In the ideal world, this layer would become a ground truth for the morphometric classification. However, that is not possible due to methodological flaws embedded in the typology.

The typology consists of following 10 types (loosely translated into English):

- organic structure
- perimeter block structure
- hybrid structure
- heterogenous structure
- village structure
- garden city structure
- modernist structure
- production area
- services area
- linear structure

While these types might work for planning purposes, they are conceptually incoherent mixing types based on morphology (organic, perimeter block) with those based on ideology (garden city, modernist), with those based on land use (production, services). Moreover, the fixation of the typology to *localities* comes with Modifiable Aerial Unit Problem (REF), leading to the inclusion of ambiguous loosely defined hybrid and heterogenous types. 

However, the typology itself, considering above mentioned limitations, reflects what the planning authority thinks Prague is composed of and it is worth studying the relation of this qualitative typology to the proposed quantitative classification. The only adaptation which needs to be done is the exclusion of hybrid and heterogenous types from the analysis due to their MAUP-based origin and of linear structure capturing railway structures only.

The data provided as polygons represented localities are spatially joined to buildings layer and features containing excluded types are removed from the data.

#### transferability \label{transfer}
Why is transeferabliby validation. 

The proposed method of identification of urban tissues is validated in the context of Prague using the methods above. However, that by itself does not ensure that the method is transferable and applicable elsewhere. Different geographical contexts, bringing various types of urban tissues, and their underlying spatial logic may be challenging for a method. The transferability of the method is a critical feature for its robustness and applicability. The method should show equal performance, in terms of identification of DHCs and consequent taxonomy, in additional case studies. TO DO TEXT ABOVE. IT IS BULLSHIT.

###### Validation of clustering in Amsterdam
The resulting clusters in Amsterdam are validated using the method proposed in section \ref{meth_validation_rel} above, using a data on the historical origin of each building. In the case of the datasets obtained from REF, each building has assigned a year of its construction. Unlike in Prague, the year does not represent the data when the area/plot was first built-up, but the latest construction. Even though the data are not initially binned, only buildings constructed after year 1800 have a specific year. To ensure the compatibility of the data with those used in Prague and to avoid issues with pre-1800 periods, the origin dates are therefore binned into 11 groups following the classification of REF (website). The rest of the validation follows the method outlined in \ref{meth_validation_rel}.

## Case studies - continuation of Prague, Amsterdam \label{case8}
The case studies applying the methods proposed in this chapter are 1) continuation of the work on Prague presented in previous chapter, and 2) inclusion of continuous built-up area of Amsterdam, Netherlands. Amsterdam shares with Prague the richness of the historical development, bringing a diverse set of tissues, but its historical context and patterns of development are very different. Due to the data availability and the 

### hierarchical clustering
The centroid values of each DHC, obtained as a mean value of each morphometric character, are used a taxonomic characters within a Ward's hierarchical clustering. The values are not reported within this study but are available within a data repository (ADD). The resulting relationship between centroids, representing the relationship between identified urban tissues, is illustrated on the dendrogram on figure \ref{fig:prg_dendrogram}. The horizontal axis represent each individual DHC, while vertical axis capture the cophenetic distance, i.e. the similarity between observations. The lower the connection between two branches is, the more similar the tissues represented by these branches tend to be. The values under each connection represent the actual cophenetic distance of a connection and number of observations which belong to the link. The different branches of the tree are coloured to ease the interpretation of the tree itself and to provide the visual link between the dendrogram and the resulting spatial distribution of branches.

![Long caption under img](source/figures/ch8/200507_dendrogram.pdf "Short caption"){#fig:prg_dendrogram width=100%}

The dendrogram shows several major bifurcations on different levels of cophenetic distance, indicating several distinct groups of urban tissues. However, the exploration and interpretation of each branch require the projection of the results into the geographical space. To allow that each cluster is coloured according to the branch of the dendrogram it belongs to, using different lightness of the same hue to distinguish between individual clusters. The spatial distribution of hierarchically represented cluster in the whole Prague is illustrated on the figure \ref{fig:PRG_hierarchical_clusters} and the detail of the city centre is shown on the figure \ref{fig:PRG_hierarchical_clusters_detail}.

Examining the dendrogram, we can highlight the different branches to understand their spatial distribution. Starting from the top of the dendrogram, from the bifurcation with the higher cophenetic distance (43.53), we can divide Prague's urban form into two major types. The right side of the tree represent urban form we could call *organised city* and is illustrated on figure \ref{fig:PRG_hierarchical_branch_7}. It consists of areas of mixed origin, spanning from historical core to modernist and contemporary developments. ==more== 

![traditional city](source/figures/ch8/PRG_hierarchical_branch_7.png "Short caption"){#fig:PRG_hierarchical_branch_7 width=100%}

*Chi-square hypothesis is ==add==. Reported Chi-square results, based on the contingency table, assessing whether there is a significant relationship between two variables (origin and clustering), are $\chi^{2} (114, N=140315) = 325595.20, p < .001$, which indicates significant relationship.‌*==text==


*Cramers-V value is 0.674, indicating high association. The association is the highest of all tested datasets. That is no surprise, as both layers (clusters and qualitative typology) are trying to describe the same aspects of the city. Considering the MAUP-related imprecision of QT dataset and error margin of clustering, we can consider clustering valid output.*
==text==

*The relation is also clearly present in composition of each cluster with only difference of distinction between village and garden city typology. To be fair, that is poorly specified in the original dataset anyway and the difference is quite unclear as it mixes historical origin and ideology with the morphological description. So the difference between the two should be taken with care as it might just be misleading.*==text==

*Single illustration of spatial distribution on the branch of historical dense city shows almost precise overlap with QT. The differences, areas marked as *perimeter blocks* in QT not captured by clusters are mostly incorrectly classified in QT due to MAUP (Dejvice University Campus, Industrial belt of Holesovice).*==text==

*Conclude. QT data shows the highest similarity to what clustering identified, and that is great. This layer should be similar as it tries to capture similar perspective of the city. The fact that it does shows such high significance tells that clustering method and classification does deliver results capturing meaningful results.*. ==TEXT==

*Conclude additional data section. The aim of the section was to validate the results of clustering using additional data. The clusters would be seen as validated if they shown significant relationship to all tested layers. The results of the validation shows significance and moderate (origin) to high association (both land-use and QT) based on tests used. These results clearly indicates that the method of identification of urban tissues proposed in the previous chapter and related hierarchical classification of urban tissues are both reflecting the morphological reality and could be seen as a valid method of urban morphology.* ==TEXT==

#### transferability
*Even though the method is validated in the context of Prague, it is unclear whether it is transferable to other contexts. It was designed with universality in mind, so the hypothesis is that it should be Abel to capture similar level of information in other geographic and historical contexts as well. To test this hypothesis, the whole methodology is applied to the case study of Amsterdam, including one layer of validation using historical origin data.* ==TEXT==

##### different case (AMS)
*Amsterdam dataset tests not only the transferability of the method, but also its scalability. The number of buildings on the input of clustering is 252,385 compared to 140,315 buildings in Prague. The results of primary and contextual characters are not presented in the main body of the text and their distributions are available as Appendix XXX. The complete data are available in the data repository REF. Since the method is following the steps defined in sections 7XXX and 8XXX, results report the selection of optimal number of components, results of clustering and hierarchical classification.* ==text==

###### clusters
*Bayesian Information Criterion shows different curve than we have seen in Prague case as it does not culminate to indicate the optimum. That is a situation which may happen with BIC and indicates overfitting of the model, which BIC is unable to correct.* ==TEXT==

![Long caption under img](source/figures/ch8/AMS_bic.pdf "Short caption"){#fig:AMS_bic width=100%}

*In cases like this, it is recommended to follow different principle of identification of optimal number of components deriver from the gradient of the curve. Because the gradient changes (it is not linear), the optimal number could be derived from the gradient curve. The optimal number of then the smallest value on the stabilised gradient. Once it flattens, i.e. the change starts to become more linear, it is not expected that larger number of components will significantly improve the classification. For that reason, the number of components used for identification of distinct homogenous clusters in Amsterdam is derived from gradient curve as 30.*. ==TEXT==


![Long caption under img](source/figures/ch8/AMS_bic_gradient.pdf "Short caption"){#fig:AMS_bic_gradient width=100%}

*Spatial distribution on the next two pages (full extent of the case study and the detail of the city centre) show potentially meaningful clusters. Especially clusters in the city centre show high degree of legibility. From this first perspective it looks promising and there is no reason to think that the method identification of clusters is not transferable*.==TEXT==

*Few examples. Consider cluster 29 on previous figure. It, with some margin of error, captures the original historical core of Amsterdam. The next concentric belt is also nicely captured. The difference between dark blue and grey/pind areas reflect the change in the planning paradigm with the rise of New Amsterdam School, captured especially bu grey cluster.* ==TEXT==

*Conclude. We wanted to try identification method in other place than Prague to make sure it works. Going though the same process, we can conclude that it does. However, the case also raised questions regarding the stability of the method of determination of number of components for Gaussian Mixture Model clustering as BIC curve did not culminate. That should be further explored in further research.*. ==TEXT==
