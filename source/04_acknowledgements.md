# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

To list everyone who influenced the following pages is impossible. Let me thank the selection of those whose footprint is the most significant.

First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to Ombretta Romice and Sergio Porta for agreeing to embark on this journey with me as my supervisors. Thank you, Ombretta, for guiding me on my first steps through the labyrinth of research. Thank you, Sergio, for your bold ideas shaping my activities.

My PhD would not be possible without Peter Elmlund and Ax:son Johnson Foundation, and the University of Strathclyde providing their contributions towards my funding. Thank you.

Thanks to Alessandra Feliciotti for never-ending peer support and cooperation on the crucial parts of the research. Thanks to David Hořák for entertaining and enlightening discussion of the *nature* of urban form, and to Alessandro Araldi and Alessandro Venerandi for endless discussions on morphometrics. Special thanks belong to Keisuke Sugano and Naoto Nakajima, who taught me to question the presence of universal rules in urban form. Many thanks to Dani Arribas-Bel for giving me enough space in the final stages of writing. 

Special thanks go to Joris Van den Bossche and the whole community behind Python ecosystem for geographic data science for their warm welcome and incredible, although mostly indirect support.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends who did not mind that I was thousands of kilometres away and supported me in all possible ways. Thank you all.
